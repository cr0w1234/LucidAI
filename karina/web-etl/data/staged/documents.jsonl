AJR 10 affirms the Legislature’s support for the federal school-based health center program authorized by Congress in 2010 and calls for an appropriation by Congress for that program. It also affirms the Legislature’s support for state and federal policies that include school-based health centers as partners for creating medical homes for all children, and for the inclusion of school-based health centers in the reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act as an important strategy for ensuring that students are physically and mentally healthy and therefore ready to learn.

Schwarzenegger in September 2008, SB 564 builds upon an earlier Ridley-Thomas bill, AB 2560, which established a Public School Health Center Support Program. SB 564 created a grant program for school health centers administered by the Public School Health Center Support Program. To date, the grant program has not been funded. Read the full text of SB 564 (PDF). <h3>AB 2560 (Ridley-Thomas): The School Health Centers Act (2006)</h3> Chapter 334, Statutes of 2006; sponsored by the California School-Based Health Alliance Signed by Gov. Schwarzenegger on Sept. 19, 2006, this law created a Public School Health Center Program jointly administered by the Department of Health Services and the Department of Education. The program was designed to collect school health center data, facilitate the development of comprehensive health centers in partnership with California public schools, and address the programmatic, clinical, finance, and policy needs of California’s school health centers. To date, the program has not been implemented because neither state funding nor staff was made available for the program. Read the full text of AB 2560 (PDF). <h3>SB 620 (Presley): Healthy Start Support Services for Children Act (1991)</h3> Chapter 759, Statutes of 1991 This bill established Healthy Start, which provides planning and implementation grants for school-based student support services and their coordination. Healthy Start programs offer: academic and educational support; youth development and employment services; family support services; and medical and mental health care. Many of California’s SBHCs started as Healthy Start programs. Healthy Start funding peaked at $39 million in the 1990s. In 2007, the program was funded at $10 million. Since 2007, no new Healthy Start grants have been awarded. <h2>Federal Laws Regarding School-Based Health Centers</h2> <h3>Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (aka Health Care Reform) (2010)</h3> Public Law 111-148, Title IV, Subtitle B, Sec 4101 This piece of legislation defines school-based health centers as providing comprehensive primary care services, including both physical and mental health services, at or near a school, in a clinic operated by a qualified sponsoring agency.

It may also provide behavioral health, dental, optometry, and/or ancillary services (i.e. health education, youth engagement, case management).

On campuses with SBHCs, about 70% of students receive free or reduced price meals. Students in communities that benefit from school-based health and wellness centers are less likely to have health insurance or access to health and mental health services that address these risk factors. Without access to high-quality health services, childhood risk factors are more likely to be translated into higher rates of diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and other chronic illnesses in adulthood as well as more struggles with academic success. Of California’s 400 school-based health and wellness centers: Most of California’s SBHCs are physically located right on campus within a main building or in a portable. In some areas, health services are provided by mobile medical or dental vans, and in other areas, “school-linked” health centers are off campus and have formal operating agreements with schools. School-based health centers and wellness centers (SBHCs/WCs) are spread from Del Norte to San Diego County with large concentrations in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area.

Many schools have begun to move away from zero-tolerance disciplinary policies and to acknowledge the social, emotional, and physical factors that shape student behavior. Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) is an increasingly popular approach. It engages all stakeholders—including teachers, administrators, service providers, and families—in actively teaching and reinforcing expected behavior. PBIS prompts schools to identify and meet student needs that manifest as inappropriate behavior, reducing serious problems and improving overall climate. Mental health specialists and other school health staff can be integral to the assessment process, through which the underlying causes of a student’s disruptive behavior are identified. SBHCs can also lead the implementation of alternative behavioral interventions, such as anger management sessions, leadership development programming, individual and group counseling sessions, and peer support groups. According to the Center for School, Health and Education at the American Public Health Association, SBHCs have a “natural role” and are a “powerful ally” in efforts to improve school climate. <h3>School Discipline Reform</h3> <h4>School Discipline & Student Substance Use: A guide for school-based health providers</h4> <h4>Alternatives to Suspension: Student Tobacco and Substance Use</h4> CSHA believes that schools can and should be safe, welcoming, and supportive environments for all students. CSHA supports advocacy efforts in California to eliminate police in schools. We also believe that school funds should go to student learning and health, and not police. To achieve this, we acknowledge that it may take school communities time to redefine school safety without relying on school police. This work does not happen overnight. However, important action is needed immediately to ensure schools are healthy and safe environments for all students…[ Read More ]” – CSHA’s Position on Police in Schools <h2>Police in Schools</h2> Black-led and youth-led community-based organizations have been advocating and organizing for police-free school campuses for years. School-based health centers and the young people they serve tell us that students need more supportive services – like primary care, behavioral health and restorative justice – instead of school police. The deaths of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and many other Black Americans brought systemic racism and police violence into sharper focus. At the California School-Based Health Alliance, our incredible Youth Board in 2020 strongly encouraged us in our role as advocates for student health to take a position against schools investing in police on campus. We have joined these brave leaders and partners by taking a position to support advocacy efforts in California to eliminate police in schools. We believe that school funds should go to student learning and health, and not police. <h2>Our Position on Police in Schools</h2> Instead of increasing school safety, research shows that the presence of school police officers has a harmful effect on all students of color and particularly Black students. SBHC/WCs and school health services play an important role in supporting positive school climates for all students, especially those that face the greatest health and education disparities. As an alternative to police, we believe that school investments should focus on practices and services that promote a positive school climate that protects every young person and their dignity. It also includes age-appropriate, non-punitive services that address student behaviors and underlying needs. Strong evidence indicates that non-punitive approaches are associated with high levels of academic achievement, healthy student development, and safe learning environments. We continue to support all schools as they strive to create environments where all students can thrive. <h2>Related Resources</h2> Swipe to see more <h2>Stay Up-to-Date on School-Based Health</h2> Sign up to receive our free newsletter and advocate for kids’ health.

{"page_id": 4010, "title": "Trauma Screening", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/schoolwide-screenings/trauma-screening/", "content": "Screening students for trauma is a process that needs to take careful consideration in order to be effective and supportive to both students and clinicians. There are many possible screeners available and every screener is a tool to be used in the context of a safe and trusted relationship with a provider. When screening for risk and trauma, it is important to also screen for resilience and protective factors and take into account the student’s overall wellbeing. Additionally, it is important to include education for the student as to why screening is taking place. Screening can be used as a tool for prevention when it is included as a part of psychoeducation and connection to building upon students’ resilience. <h2>Considerations for Trauma Screening</h2> <h3>Is the clinic using trauma-informed practices?</h3> Trauma-informed practices in a clinic setting means a clinic is a safe space where all staff understand the impacts of trauma and how to create nurturing environments. <h3>What is the screening tool designed to identify?</h3> Some trauma screening tools identify symptoms and severity of symptoms of PTSD according to the DSM 5. Some trauma screening tools screen for whether or not a youth has experienced traumatic events. Some tools screen for both. There are also tools that screen for other risk factors such as substance use, depression and anxiety. Some tools screen for environmental factors and social determinants of health. Additionally, there are screening tools that can be helpful in identifying resilience and protective factors in young people’s lives. <h3>Who will be screened? Individual students coming into the health center, classrooms of students, or grade levels?</h3> The capacity of providers to meet the needs identified should determine the ongoing processes for screening. Putting into place active MOUs with referral sources to community providers can increase access to care and the amount of screening that can be conducted. <h3>What will be done with the results?</h3> Have plans in place prior to screening students for how students will be followed up with regarding the screening results. If a classroom of students is screened for trauma symptoms, have the policies in place for the process of who will follow up with the students and how the student will be connected to services. <h3>What services are available for students who have needs identified and what are the policies and practices for connecting students to needed services?</h3> Before conducting large-scale screenings, identify the service providers in the area and whether they have openings, what the referral processes are like, and how accessible the services are to the students. Have all staff in the SBHC trained in how to connect students to services that may be identified as needs before conducting screenings. <h2>Screening Tools Implemented by SBHCs</h2> <h3>Trauma Screener</h3> <h3>Health & Social Influencers of Health Screener</h3> <h3>Substance Use Screener</h3> <h3>Mental Health Screeners</h3> <h3>Resilience Screeners</h3> <h2>Practices for Screening Students</h2> There are many ways to integrate screening into practice.

{"page_id": 3927, "title": "Schoolwide Screenings: Case Studies", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/schoolwide-screenings/case-studies/", "content": "<h3>Native American Health Center, Oakland</h3> <h2>Oral Health Screening for All at Life Academy SBHC</h2> Students in Oakland face harsh odds: Given these overwhelming realities, clinic leaders knew that “selling” the importance of oral health to school administration and teachers might be a challenge. Why would school leaders and teachers focus on dental screening when there are so many other difficult issues to address? Framing oral health as an equity issue was the chosen approach, given that many of the school’s students had never even seen a dentist. Schoolwide dental screenings were launched when Native American Health Center (NAHC) received a grant focused on integrating oral health into primary care. Originally, dental screenings started at one SBHC and then expanded to three other sites; dental screenings are now in seven NAHC health centers, including Life Academy. At the outset, the goals of the schoolwide dental screening were simple: In the beginning, teachers were somewhat suspicious, but NAHC’s staff, and particularly the dental director, worked hard to earn teachers’ trust, even offering dental screenings for teachers. Over time, the screening results illustrated an overwhelming need, and teachers and school leaders came to understand that children from low-income families are disproportionately affected by poor access to dental care. Their buy-in for the schoolwide dental screenings would be instrumental to its success. Screening large numbers of students requires good organizational skills and a well-defined process. SBHC staff broke down their process into three phases: Preparation involved making sure everyone was on the same page, having all the supplies there on time, and logistics. The first year, SBHC staff chose to do the screenings in February in honor of Oral Health Month. Once the dates were selected, they formed and prepared their team. SBHC staff recruited extra support from the NAHC dental department and developed a formal partnership with the UCSF dental and nursing schools to have hands-on support on screening days. Staff then coordinated dates, times, and location with the school administration. School administrators were most amenable to the schoolwide screenings taking place during PE class, and the school gym was used to allow for enough space. SBHC staff met with teachers and other school staff to review logistics. To simplify and speed up the approval process, staff chose to use an opt-out consent form so that parents would only need to sign if they did not want their child to participate. They identified which students were Medicaid patients in advance so they could bill for those screenings and varnish applications. Staff also launched an outreach/media campaign. Outreach was essential to get the word out and included development of a poster that would appeal to teens with a message to “Check Your Smile.” Finally, SBHC staff ordered and prepared the supplies, which included clipboards and pens, gloves, gauze, varnish, masks, hand sanitizer, and goody bags. Implementation of the schoolwide screening involved good set-up of the area and preparation for a fast and furious flow of students. On screening day, with hundreds of students expected, having extra staff was extremely helpful and required a clear process flow and defined roles. For example, it was very helpful to have one staff person be in charge of crowd control and another give instructions to students. Both of these staff members worked in the waiting area, managing the flow of students to the dentists and protecting the privacy of the students being screened. The set-up in the gym included a waiting area and a screened area (for privacy) for the dentist and a “recorder” to document the clinical notes and complete the screening tools. Recorders are individuals without special training who transcribe the dentist’s screening observations on the bottom of the screening forms. For example, the dentist will note aloud whether there is previous history of decay, current decay, and so on, and the recorder makes notes accordingly. Recorders help maintain the flow of a fast-paced screening event by relieving the dentist of documentation responsibilities. After the dentist visit, the student is sent to a varnisher. Varnishers can be a dentist, dental hygienist or other health care professional, and their role is to apply fluoride varnish—a highly concentrated form of fluoride applied to the tooth’s surface as a type of topical fluoride therapy. SBHC staff found that getting the right staff ratios was very important on screening days; the ideal ratio is one recorder for every dentist, and three varnishers for every one dentist, or five varnishers for every two dentists. This set-up and staff support plan kept the dental screening running smoothly and efficiently. Case management was the most challenging part of the dental screening process. To identify high-risk students, the SBHC developed a case management tool in which students could be classified on a scale of 1 to 4 (1=no decay, 2=some suspicious areas, 3=urgent but not in pain, and 4=urgent and in pain). From the screening, 17% of students were identified as needing urgent care, meaning they received a classification of 3 or 4 on the screening tool. While all screenings get some sort of follow-up, such as a letter home about the screening results, students identified with urgent needs require a more intensive approach. In addition to notification of their caregivers, the SBHC also worked to identify any insurance coverage and schedule a follow-up appointment. For students with no existing coverage, staff assisted with insurance enrollment. Follow-up appointments were scheduled with providers in the SBHC, the NAHC main dental clinic, or other community dental health providers. <h2>Screening During 9th Grade Clinic Visits at Fremont Tiger Clinic</h2> <h3>La Clínica de la Raza, Oakland</h3> Fremont High School is an urban public high school located in the Fruitvale District of East Oakland, California, and the school has had an onsite SBHC operated by La Clínica de la Raza for 21 years. The Fremont Tiger Clinic is part of the school culture. Clinic staff wear school jerseys, participate in school events, and act as adult allies for students. The SBHC is centrally located in the high school, allowing students more opportunity to drop in for small needs. The clinic has good recognition, and there is widespread belief that the SBHC is providing value to students. Each year for the last several years, the Fremont Tiger Clinic has held a 2-day event targeting every 9th grade student in the school. Functioning like a schoolwide screening, this annual registration drive allows the SBHC to establish connections with approximately 130 students annually. These relationships pay off in the years to come as students feel comfortable and willing to return to the SBHC for clinic services. The annual screening event allows staff the opportunity to assess all incoming students’ health needs and register them as patients in the clinic. The goals are to have every 9th grade student come through the clinic, meet a provider, and complete a brief screening. Like any schoolwide screening, the Tiger Clinic 9th grade adolescent screenings require a well-defined process that includes preparation, implementation, and follow-up. Preparation for the 2-day screening begins with coordination. Clinic staff work with administration and teachers to establish dates and plan event logistics. Two weeks before the event, SBHC staff work with 9th grade teachers to visit the classroom to do a 30-minute presentation. Staff explain the upcoming screening drive, when all 9th graders will be doing a tour of the clinic and receiving a brief provider visit. They describe the services offered at the SBHC and ask all students to complete pre-registration paperwork, including minor consent and Family Planning, Access, Care and Treatment (FPACT) enrollment forms. Students complete and return all pre-registration paperwork during the classroom visit to save time on screening day. After the classroom visits, SBHC staff use administrative time to process all student registration paperwork. Entering new patient registration information, activating FPACT, and screening for student insurance eligibility requires about 20 minutes per student. SBHC staff also prepare by enlisting additional clinical staff (often borrowed from other La Clínica sites) to help with the screening. Before the students arrive, staff assemble student gift bags with free goodies (i.e., water bottles, pens, stress balls, granola bars, and condoms) and set up the clinic for an easy, comfortable flow. Implementation involves moving all 9th graders through the clinic and screening them for services. SBHC staff call students to the health clinic in groups of five to eight. When they arrive in the health center, they are welcomed with juice and snacks and seated in the waiting area to complete a brief screening questionnaire. The intention is to “normalize” the clinic so that students will feel comfortable returning. During the clinic visit, each 9th grade student receives a brief (15 minute) individual visit with a provider, such as a family nurse practitioner, health educator, or mental health clinician. The visit includes an overview of SBHC services, confidentiality, and mandated reporting so that students have a clear understanding of their patient rights. Students then receive a sexual health screen and a SSHADESS assessment. The SSHADESS assessment includes questions about Strengths, School, Home, Activities, Employment, Drugs, Emotions, Suicidality, Sexuality, and Safety (including violence, abuse, and self-harm). After the basic screening is completed, students are given an opportunity to ask questions and offered goody bags before they are sent back to class. Follow-up after the 9th grade registration event requires staff to review each case individually to identify health needs. All screenings are reviewed by a medical provider to ensure that clinical or psychosocial concerns are addressed and flagged for follow-up. Each year, about one-third of the students screened need immediate services. For these students, SBHC staff work to schedule follow-up appointments in the SBHC or give referrals to other providers as needed. Billing and insurance information is reviewed for each student; those with no existing coverage are offered help with insurance enrollment. After the screening, SBHC staff members thank teachers and school administrators for their support and report back on population health data collected. <h2>Lessons Learned</h2> <h3>Partnerships Are Key</h3> Among the many lessons learned, the most important is the value of partnerships. Staff at Life Academy SBHC said this is true for school-based health in general, but shared that they learned it again and again with their oral health initiative. The collaboration with the NAHC dental department and with the UCSF dental and nursing students allowed the SBHC to reach greater numbers of youth and train new professionals in the value of oral health integration into school-based health. At Fremont Tiger Clinic building strong partnerships with school staff is a key priority because they control access to the classroom. Teachers and administrators can be important allies if they understand how the screening process improves access and ensures that poor health is not a barrier to learning. <h3>Screenings Can Be Institutionalized & Increase Patient Engagement</h3> The annual dental screening process has become significantly easier and is now part of the routine at Life Academy. While the grant has ended, the SBHC continues to do the annual screenings with great success. Students, teachers, and administration know what to expect and value the services being provided. While the very early planning stages of the dental screening required SBHC staff to figure out how to “sell” oral health, over time the dental screenings were appreciated and became a gateway to other SBHC services for students. At Fremont High, the screening drive has become routine at the school, and the patient population is steady as a result. Year after year, the screenings increase awareness about the clinic services and serve as a cost-effective approach to engaging more patients and building sustainability. <h3>Schoolwide Screenings Provide an Opportunity for Health Career Exposure</h3> One of the biggest surprises was youth interest in dentistry and health care as career options. During schoolwide screenings, youth were very curious not only about fluoride varnish but also about the people who applied it. As students were exposed to nurse practitioners in training, dentists, medical assistants, and physicians, the screening became an introduction to a variety of health professions. Life Academy for Health and Bioscience is a “health pathways” school and offers a unique class on becoming a medical assistant. After the screening, Life Academy added a component to their medical assistant class that focuses on oral health and fluoride application. The dental screening continues to inspire interest in dental and health careers.

Using supervised volunteer personnel, such as health profession trainees, can also increase billing potential by increasing the number of patients seen in one period of time, without decreasing the quality or content of the visit, in addition to cutting down personnel costs. <h3>Defining & Assigning Responsibilities</h3> Use staff meetings or other regular interactions with staff to elicit feedback on program development and to provide role information. Be sure all staff clearly understand their role and responsibilities. Consider using one of these meetings to do a “dress rehearsal” to review how the students will flow through the event. If outside staff or volunteers will be used to support your program, consider what type of orientation they might need to become familiar with your site or program. Be prepared to adjust your flow for unexpected events during your program. <h3>Communication</h3> As your event approaches, take opportunities to regularly check-in with the school administration and teachers involved in the event, to share your outline of the event flow and confirm timing, etc. If you are using health professions trainees to support your event, develop a brief outline or handout that university faculty can use to prepare trainees for the event. If possible, make time for a staff debrief at the end of at least the first program day, to review successes and challenges and make any necessary changes to improve future events.

{"page_id": 3916, "title": "Screening Models", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/schoolwide-screenings/screening-models/", "content": "<h2>Below are three different screening models ranging from the least to most time and resource intensive.</h2> <h3>1. Screen in the Classroom</h3> Screening in the classroom is the least time and resource intensive. The SBHC can give a class presentation about the clinic, services available, and purpose of screening. They can also provide some health education (i.e., meaning of minor consent, confidentiality, psychoeducation/mindfulness). Then students can complete the confidential screen as a large group or in small groups of 5-8 (hard copy or electronic). <h4>Pros</h4> <h4>Cons</h4> <h3>2. Screen During Clinic Tour</h3> Students can visit the SBHC in small groups or as a whole class. Hands-on/participatory stations can be set up for students to get familiar with the health center. One station should be dedicated to helping the youth complete the screen. SBHCs could make this a ‘career exploration’ – an opportunity to/talk to career professionals at each station. <h4>Pros</h4> <h4>Cons</h4> <h3>3. Screen During Clinic Visit & Registration</h3> Students complete the paperwork to enroll as a clinic patient (can happen prior to visit). Students can visit the SBHC in small groups or as a whole class. Stations can be set up for students to get familiar with the health center. Students receive a brief one-on-one provider visit. This visit is billable (MediCal or Family PACT). <h4>Pros</h4> <h4>Cons</h4> <h2>Location of Screening SBHC Space</h2> If you need private areas for confidential discussions or exams, consider how other space in your clinic might be re-purposed in addition to the exam rooms (such as offices, conference rooms, or lab areas) in order to increase your capacity for seeing multiple patients at once. Don’t forget to consider spatial logistics and potentials for bottlenecks in your flow, such as only having one bathroom in your clinic if your goal is to collect urine samples for STI screening on multiple students in a short period of time. If other clinic services will be suspended during the event, develop a secondary plan for how urgent or acute drop-in visits will be handled. If you anticipate generating a large number of follow-up visits from your program, consider how you might adjust future clinic schedules and/or recruit additional staff or providers to accommodate. Be creative in maximizing space for your screening needs. If your program includes interventions that are non-invasive and/or can be conducted in semi-private areas, consider talking to the school about using large areas such as the gym, cafeteria, or auditorium and developing temporary privacy screens or partitions to divide up the space. If you use a venue outside the clinic for screening, but patient recruitment and/or exposure to your clinic is one of your goals, see if there is a way to incorporate a visit to the clinic as part of the screening program. <h2>Timing of Screening Program Duration</h2> Once you have determined the group and approximate numbers of students you intend to screen, create a detailed and realistic schedule for your screening event, including checking in students, onsite health education, measurements, surveys, additional testing you will include, and any face-to-face time with a provider. This should result in an estimate of the staffing you will need and the number of students you can feasibly screen in one class period. Then estimate the number of class periods it will take to complete screening for your population of choice. As soon as possible, contact the school administration to review the overall school calendar and identify a time that will avoid major schedule conflicts, such as school vacations, standardized testing weeks, and/or other school-wide celebrations (graduation, etc.) and allow adequate time for follow-up. If the school desires the screening program to coincide with a particular course (i.e., science, health, etc.), be sure to consult with teachers as to when it might fit best in the curricular plan. If you are planning to incorporate the use of health profession trainees to expand your personnel capabilities, consult with program faculty to determine if trainee availability will coincide with your timeline. The above information will help you narrow down the days and times when your screening program can take place. Even if overall coordination is done with the school administration, it is wise to connect with individual teachers directly to ensure that you are not conflicting with any scheduled classroom initiatives, tests, or field trips.

{"page_id": 3912, "title": "Schoolwide Screenings", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/schoolwide-screenings/", "content": "School-based health centers (SBHCs) throughout California are continually working to evolve their practices to better serve students. One of the best practices identified by the California School-Based Health Alliance (CSHA) is the use of schoolwide or grade level screenings, which allow SBHCs to use their unique location on the school campus to provide education, population health, and prevention. This toolkit is designed to help SBHCs implement a schoolwide or grade-level screening. <h2>Benefits of Conducting Schoolwide Screening</h2> Schoolwide screenings conducted in SBHCs can be used to screen large populations of students and provide an opportunity to expand reach to new students, enhance collaboration between SBHCs and schools, increase student awareness of SBHCs, and support the financial stability of SBHCs. Schoolwide screenings are a good way to get students in the health center; they can be used as an outreach mechanism and can increase the percentage of the student body that the health center serves. Schoolwide screenings improve access to care by allowing health center staff to reach out proactively to students rather than waiting for students to walk in. Some students are less willing or even fearful of seeking help in a clinical setting, so it’s important for SBHCs to establish connections with students. Schoolwide screenings can be conducted to identify students that would benefit the most from SBHC programs. Some examples include obesity, sexually transmitted infections, asthma, oral health, and mental health. Screenings can also be used as a means to register new students. Often these screenings are done with the incoming grade, such as kindergarten, 6th, or 9th, and are used as a way to register new students. Schools and SBHCs have common goals: the health, wellbeing, and academic success of students. By participating in mandated and other important screenings across schools, grades, or classes, SBHCs can strengthen this natural collaboration. In addition to screenings discussed above, SBHCs could participate in traditionally mandated screenings such as visual acuity, possibly conducting additional screenings and assisting with follow-up. Joint screening projects can strengthen the relationship between school and clinic personnel, and children and youth can benefit. Young people who attend SBHC consistently express satisfaction with the services they receive, and find their SBHC providers to be more approachable than providers in traditional health centers. In our experience, some youth, especially those in middle school and younger grades, may have fears and misconceptions about the services provided and may not come in for care on their own. Screening programs can serve as an excellent entry point to the SBHC for students who otherwise may not be aware of the clinic’s services, or are hesitant to come in for a visit. Presenting opportunities for students to access the clinic along with their peers may create a safe space for learning about what the clinic has to offer while also dispelling misconceptions that may exist about becoming a clinic patient. Schoolwide screenings may also benefit the financial sustainability of an SBHC. If your screening campaign can be structured in a way that includes billable visits or procedures, it can be an instrumental way to increase opportunities for revenue. In the following section we discuss two of these strategies: bringing in staff from other centers for a concentrated and streamlined clinic day, and incorporating nursing and other health science student volunteers who can increase clinic capacity while engaging in the screenings as a service learning project. Follow-up visits generated from screening campaigns can also increase opportunities for future billable visits. Screening campaigns can be part of a “smart financing” strategy to leverage multiple resources. <h2>Goal of Screening</h2> Identifying the goal for implementing a schoolwide screening program at a SBHC during the planning phase is essential to success. Consider the following potential goals for implementing a screening program. Consideration of which health indicators you seek to impact with the screening is essential. The goals of the screening can range from Healthy People goals, to site-specific areas you have identified as a need in your clinic or organization. Consider performing a needs assessment at your site before developing your screening program. This can not only help you determine how to best target your program, but also give you some baseline data to use later to evaluate its success. Ideally, the screening program will include or lead to patient enrollment and future visits. Build in an opportunity for students to become more familiar with the SBHC and its services in a more comfortable way, such as in the company of classmates and friends. <h2>Target Population</h2> After clarifying the Goals and Objectives of your screening program, the population you intend to reach should be defined. Consider realistically what your clinic can handle based on your resources. If your school has a large student body, identify ways to reduce numbers either by only targeting specific grade levels and/or groups that are at highest risk. Develop a plan for whether and how to include students who are absent on the day of your program and how that follow-up will occur. If your aim is to reach the entire student body, consider spreading out the campaign so that smaller groups are screened at multiple times during the school year, rather than all at once. Determine whether consent should be provided by the parent and/or student, and whether written or “opt-out” consent is most appropriate. Students may sign their own consent for services covered under minor consent laws, whereas general medical and dental care must be done with parent or guardian consent. For a guide to minor consent laws in your area, consult an adolescent health law resource, such as the National Center for Youth Law . School districts often have specific policies about whether and under what circumstances they allow “opt-out” consents: parents are notified and consent is implied unless parents specifically return the opt-out form. Save time by noting which students are already enrolled as patients of the SBHC, and thus may already have consents on file. When possible, attempt to obtain consent and/or patient registration forms before the day of the screening event, as this will speed up flow. <h2>Screening Recommendations</h2> Universal screening can identify many diseases and health conditions in children.

SBHCs are a way for community schools to bring reliable, affordable, quality health care services to students and their families in an accessible and coordinated way. “Every Community School should have a school-based health center” – José Muñoz, Director, Coalition for Community Schools <h3>SBHCs & Community Schools Work Together</h3> “Our SBHC staff have developed a rare institutional trust with students, families, and community members, which is essential for providing care. During shelter-in-place, our SBHCs and health partners have been able to lean into these existing relationships with our students and families … The bottom line is that SBHCs provide essential health care in Oakland’s most high-need neighborhoods.” – Curtiss Sarikey, Oakland Unified School District, from School-Based Health Centers: Trusted Lifelines in a Time of Crisis <h3>State Funding: California Community Schools Partnership Program</h3> The California Department of Education has invested in the planning, implementation, and support of community schools through the California Community Schools Partnership Program. The goal of this program is to improve student outcomes through supporting schools in partnering with community agencies and local governments. Funds through the Community Schools Partnership Program cannot be used for construction of School-based Health and Wellness Centers but can be used to purchase mobile health units to provide health, dental, vision and mental health services. LEAs can use this opportunity to launch new services using their own personnel, or partnering with community health providers. More information can be found on CDE’s website . <h3>How LEAs and Partners Can Braid New Funding to Support SBHCs</h3> The California School-Based Health Alliance (CSHA) has a guide to assist in local planning and strategy that shows local education agencies (LEAs) and partners how they can braid together new state funding opportunities – including those for full-service community schools – to support new school-based health centers (SBHCs) or expand and improve existing SBHCs. <h4>Examples of Community Schools Efforts</h4> <h4>Resources for Practice</h4> <h5>Organizations</h5> <h3>Additional Resources</h3> <h4>School Health Partnerships</h4> Successful school-based health centers and wellness centers (SBHC/WCs) rely on the collaborative efforts of a diverse group of partners.

{"page_id": 3440, "title": "Student", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/hipaa-ferpa-guide-california/providing-minor-consent-including-mental-health-and-sexual-and-reproductive-health-srh-services/", "content": "Yes. The same consent rules apply whether the services are provided on or off-campus and whether the provider is required to comply with HIPAA or FERPA confidentiality laws. Under California law, minors of any age may consent to both sexual assault services and pregnancy-related health care (including contraception, pregnancy testing, prenatal care, abortion, and postnatal care), and minors 12 and older may consent to care related to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. Minors 12 and older may also consent to mental health counseling in many cases. A clinic or school cannot adopt a policy that requires obtaining parent consent for these services, as such a policy would conflict with state constitutional and statutory law. (See Covered Entities in Additional Resources.) HIPAA/CA : If the records are subject to HIPAA and CMIA, the health provider cannot disclose information or share records related to minor consent services provided to the student without obtaining written authorization from the student on a HIPAA/CMIA-compliant authorization form. 123 FERPA : If the records are within an education file subject to FERPA, the parent may access the information for students under age 18. Generally, a parent has the right to review their minor child’s education record.  FERPA does not obligate the school or school employed health provider to affirmatively notify parents of any services delivered, however. If a provider believes that disclosing records may put a student in danger, the provider should contact legal counsel. It depends. If a school nurse, or another health provider subject to FERPA, documents minor consent information, this becomes part of the education file and is subject to FERPA. Information in the education file of a student 18 and younger can always be disclosed to the principal with parent consent. Absent parent consent, FERPA permits a school to disclose information in the education record to other school officials as long as the school official has a legitimate educational interest in the information. 124 A principal is a school official, but the principal can only access the information if the principal has a legitimate educational interest in the information. FERPA requires schools to include in their annual notices to parents a statement indicating whether the school has a policy of disclosing information from the education file to school officials, and, if so, which parties are considered school officials for this purpose and what the school considers to be a “legitimate educational interest.” 125 For the most part, no. The records of health providers operating under FERPA are part of the education record, and parents have a right to inspect the education record of their minor child if they choose to do so. 126 There is no exception under FERPA that limits parent inspection rights simply because the information in the record pertains to health care services, with one caveat. Parents usually do not have the right to inspect health information in the education record of students eighteen and older, though there are exceptions to this rule as well. 127 It is important to note, however, that to the extent the school health provider holds information that is not in the education record, (such as information from a conversation that was not recorded), the information would not be subject to FERPA. State law requires school officials to excuse students from school to attend confidential medical appointments. Confidential appointments are appointments to receive services that minors can obtain on their own consent under state or federal law. This includes the mental health and sexual and reproductive health services described in Covered Entities in Additional Resources. The school cannot require that the student have parent or guardian consent in order to attend the appointment and cannot notify parents or guardians when students choose to leave for an appointment during the school day. 128 For more information on the confidential medical release, including implementation and documentation of absences, please see National Center for Youth Law’s “ Confidential Medical Release: Frequently Asked Questions from Schools and Districts ”, available at www.teenhealthlaw.org . If a school-based provider is subject to FERPA, the provider cannot promise that a parent will not be able to access sexual reproductive health information documented in the education file. Providers subject to HIPAA and CMIA, however, can promise patients additional confidentiality protections. For some students, this guarantee of confidentiality is critical. These students may choose not to access needed care if confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. In these cases, the provider whose records are subject to FERPA may wish to consider referring the student to a provider operating under HIPAA, and confidential medical release is one mechanism the student can use to make such an appointment possible.

{"page_id": 3435, "title": "School Nurses", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/hipaa-ferpa-guide-california/school-nurse-records-and-communications/", "content": "Student health records maintained by a school nurse are part of the education record subject to FERPA. California law also may apply to health information held by a school nurse. (See Glossary of Key Terms in Additional Resources .) Education records are covered by FERPA. In general, a school nurse’s records become part of the school’s education record, as they contain information related to a student and are maintained by a school employee or agent. 90 These records are not covered by HIPAA because HIPAA specifically exempts from its coverage health information in an education record. However, California confidentiality law, including licensing rules, may still apply to some information held by the nurse. In some cases, these laws may conflict with FERPA. For example, if a student receives minor consent care, a parent’s right to access related health information is different under FERPA and California law. If FERPA and California law provide conflicting obligations regarding disclosure or protection, school nurses should seek guidance from their legal counsel about which rule to follow. Generally, treatment records created by a school nurse are subject to FERPA, even if the records are kept in a separate file cabinet or file. Thus, while a school nurse may maintain a separate file as a means to limit accidental disclosures, the file still would be subject to FERPA in most cases. There are two types of records that are not considered part of an education record, though, and would not be subject to FERPA: Whether either of these two exceptions applies is something to address with legal counsel. Yes, FERPA still applies. Joint Guidance from the U.S. Departments of Education and Health and Human Services addresses this question: “Some schools may receive a grant from a foundation or government agency to hire a nurse. Notwithstanding the source of  the funding,  if the nurse is hired as a school official (or a contractor [of the educational agency]), the records maintained by the nurse or clinic are ‘education  records’ subject to FERPA.” 93 (emphasis added). In most cases, yes. The information may be disclosed pursuant to a HIPAA/CMIA-compliant written authorization. Alternatively, HIPAA and California law also permit health care providers to disclose protected health information to other health care providers for “treatment” purposes. HIPAA defines “treatment” broadly in this context to include coordination or management of health care, consultation, and referral as well as direct treatment. 94 Health providers also are allowed to disclose information to other providers even without authorization in a few other circumstances, such as in certain medical emergencies. It is important to note that once disclosed to the school nurse, if the school nurse places the information in the pupil file, FERPA likely will apply when determining access to the information in the file, not HIPAA .95 This means that information that was once protected under HIPAA may lose those protections once it is placed in a student’s education file. In limited circumstances, yes. The information may be disclosed pursuant to a valid FERPA-compliant written authorization. If there is no authorization in place, information can only be disclosed in a few limited circumstances. For example, the school could provide the health provider access to directory information about a specific student absent parental consent. What that would include will depend on how directory information has been defined by that school district in its annual notice to parents and whether parents have opted out. In addition, the school nurse also may disclose to the pediatrician information that is not contained in the education record, such as information from oral communications or personal observations that have not been recorded, as long as the disclosure does not violate professional codes of conduct or contractual obligations. 96 In an emergency, the information in the education record may be disclosed to appropriate persons pursuant to the emergency exception, described below in May a school nurse disclose information from the education record in an emergency?. Yes. FERPA authorizes disclosures to “appropriate  parties”  if  “knowledge  of the information is necessary to  protect  the  health  or  safety of  the  student or other individuals.” 97 This exception allows disclosure in response to  a  specific situation that poses an imminent danger.  The release may occur “if the agency or institution determines, on a case-by-case basis, that a specific situation presents imminent danger or threat to students or other members of the community, or requires an immediate need for information in order to avert or diffuse serious threats to the safety or health of a student or other individuals.” 98 “In making [this] determination”, FERPA goes on to  say,  “an educational  agency or institution may take into account the totality of the circumstances pertaining to a threat to the health or safety of a student or other individuals. If the educational agency or institution determines that there is an articulable and significant threat to the health or safety of a student or other individuals, it may disclose information from education records to any person whose knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals. If, based on the information available at  the time of the determination, there is a rational basis for the determination, the Department will not substitute its judgment for that of the educational agency or institution in evaluating the circumstances and making its determination.” 99 Providers also should consult their ethical and licensing rules for applicable guidance, such as guidance on when the Tarasoff duty to warn may apply.

Once you determine if your records are subject to HIPAA or FERPA, you can review the more detailed questions below.  We start off with FERPA specific questions, including questions about educational counseling.  For the Sharing and Disclosure Questions, each question has an answer for HIPAA and FERPA.  You can just read the answer that applies to you, or you can read both and see how it affects your counterparts!  The last section covers minor consent laws and how it can interact with HIPAA and FERPA. <h2>FERPA Specific Questions</h2> “Educational counseling” means specialized services provided by a school counselor possessing a valid credential with a specialization in pupil personnel services who is assigned specific times to directly counsel pupils. 3 Cal Educ. Code 49600(b) California law says that “information of a personal nature” 52 disclosed by a student 12 and older, or the student’s parents, to a school counselor 53 as part of receiving “educational counseling” 54 does not become part of the pupil record, and access to that information is very limited. 55 (See endnote for limitations.) The statute goes on to say that “[i]t is the intent of the Legislature that counselors use the privilege of confidentiality under this section to assist the pupil whenever possible to communicate more effectively with parents, school staff, and others.” Before relying on this rule, it is critical to discuss this law with school district legal counsel to understand its scope and any possible conflicts with FERPA. Generally, records created by a school counselor are subject to FERPA, even if the records are kept in a separate file cabinet or file. Thus, while a school counselor may maintain a separate file as a means to limit accidental disclosures, the file still would be subject to FERPA in most cases. There are two types of records that are not considered part of an education record, though, and would not be subject to FERPA. In addition, California law states that certain educational counseling records do not become part of the pupil file. (See the California Guide main page page “Do exceptions in FERPA allow educational agencies to disclose information without a release form?” and Endnotes 53 and 54.) Whether either of these two exceptions applies to exempt school counselor files from FERPA is something to address with legal counsel. <h2>Sharing and Disclosure Questions for both HIPAA & FERPA Behavioral Health Providers</h2> HIPAA/Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) : If a provider’s records are subject to HIPAA/CMIA, then the provider can share information pursuant to a HIPAA/CMIA-compliant signed authorization. Otherwise, there is no exception under HIPAA that would allow a provider to share protected health information with a teacher for this purpose. FERPA : If the records are subject to FERPA, yes in several situations. The provider can release if a FERPA-compliant release form is in place. In addition, an exception in FERPA allows school staff to share information with “school officials” in the same educational agency who have a “legitimate educational interest” in the information. The term “school official” includes school staff, such as teachers, counselors, principals, and school nurses. A school or district may define this term more broadly in its school policies so that it also includes outside consultants, contractors   or volunteers to whom a school has outsourced a school function if certain conditions are met. 76 The school official must have a “legitimate educational interest” in the information. This phrase has been defined to mean that the school official needs the information to perform his or her official duties. 77 FERPA requires schools to include in their annual notices to parents a statement indicating whether the school has a policy of disclosing information from the education file to school officials, and, if so, which parties are considered school officials for this purpose and what the school considers to be a “legitimate educational interest.” 78 HIPAA / CMIA : If the records are subject to HIPAA/CMIA, they may be shared in some cases. The information may be disclosed pursuant to a valid HIPAA/CMIA-compliant written authorization. (See Requirements for Release of Information Forms ) In addition, HIPAA and state medical confidentiality law permit behavioral health providers to share information related to outpatient care (except psychotherapy notes) with other health and behavioral health care professionals for purposes of treatment. The therapist has discretion to determine what disclosures are appropriate in these cases. 104 Providers also are allowed to disclose information to other providers absent authorization in a few other circumstances, such as in certain medical emergencies pursuant to an emergency exception (described below in “May a behavioral health provider disclose protected health information in an emergency?”). FERPA : If the records are subject to FERPA, they may be shared in some cases. The information may be disclosed pursuant to a valid FERPA-compliant written authorization. (See Requirements for Release of Information Forms ) If there is no authorization in place, information can only be disclosed in a few limited circumstances. For example, the school could provide the health provider access to directory information about a specific student absent parent consent. What that would include will depend on how directory information has been defined by that school district in its annual notice to parents and whether parents have opted out. In addition, the school also may disclose information to the provider that is not contained in the education record, such as information from oral communications or personal observation that have not been recorded as long as the disclosure does not violate professional codes of conduct or contractual obligations. 106 In an emergency, the information in the education record may be disclosed to appropriate persons pursuant to the emergency exception. (For more information, see “May a behavioral health provider disclose protected health information in an emergency?”) HIPAA/CMIA : If the records are subject to HIPAA/CMIA, they may be shared in some cases. The information may be disclosed pursuant to a valid HIPAA/CMIA-compliant written authorization. In addition, HIPAA and state medical confidentiality law permit behavioral health providers to share information related to outpatient care (except psychotherapy notes) with other health and behavioral health care professionals for purposes of treatment. The therapist has discretion to determine what disclosures are appropriate in these cases. 104 Providers also are allowed to disclose information to other providers absent authorization in a few other circumstances, such as in certain medical emergencies pursuant to an emergency exception (described below in “May a behavioral health provider disclose protected health information in an emergency?”). It is important to note that once disclosed to a school employee, if the school employee places the information in the pupil file, FERPA likely will apply when determining access to the information in the file, not HIPAA. 105 This means that information that was once protected under HIPAA may lose those protections once it is placed in a student’s education file. FERPA : If the records are subject to FERPA, yes in several situations. The provider can release if a FERPA-compliant release form is in place. In addition, an exception in FERPA allows school staff to share information with “school officials” in the same educational agency who have a “legitimate educational interest” in the information. The term “school official” includes school staff, such as school employed counselors. The school official must have a “legitimate educational interest” in the information. This phrase has been defined to mean that the school official needs the information to perform his or her official duties. 77 FERPA requires schools to include in their annual notices to parents a statement indicating whether the school has a policy of disclosing information from the education file to school officials, and, if so, which parties are considered school officials for this purpose and what the school considers to be a “legitimate educational interest.” 78 In addition, FERPA authorizes disclosures to “appropriate parties” if “knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals” 113 in response to a specific situation that poses an imminent danger. The release may occur “if the agency or institution determines, on a case-by-case basis, that a specific situation presents imminent danger or threat to students or other members of the community, or requires an immediate need for information in order to avert or diffuse serious threats to the safety or health of a student or other individuals.” 114 The school based provider will be required to protect the information subject to FERPA. 115 HIPAA/CMIA : If the records are subject to HIPAA and CMIA, yes. HIPAA and CMIA allow a health care provider to disclose otherwise protected health information in order to avert a serious threat to health or safety. Specifically, HIPAA says that a provider may disclose information, consistent with applicable law and ethical principles, if the provider in good faith believes the disclosure: There is a presumption that a provider acted in good faith in making such a disclosure if the provider’s belief is based on actual knowledge or in reliance on a credible representation by a person with apparent knowledge or authority. 79 Therapists are permitted to disclose psychotherapy notes without authorization under emergency circumstances. 80 It is important also to review which California law may apply to the records in question and under what circumstances disclosure absent written authorization is allowed in an emergency under the applicable law. Under California law, a therapist may disclose medical information as necessary to prevent or lessen a threat to the health or safety of a reasonably foreseeable victim or victims. Exactly when and to whom such information can be disclosed will depend on which California law the therapist is providing services under. For example, if the health information is subject to CMIA, the therapist may disclose information to any person reasonably able to prevent or lessen the threat, including the target of the threat. 81 Therapists should consult their own legal counsel for more information and guidance on which California confidentiality law applies to their records. Providers also should consult their ethical and licensing rules for applicable guidance, such as guidance on when the Tarasoff duty to warn may apply. FERPA : If the records are subject to FERPA, yes. FERPA authorizes disclosures to “appropriate parties” if “knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals.” 82 This exception allows disclosure in response to a specific situation that poses an imminent danger. The release may occur “if the agency or institution determines, on a case-by-case basis, that a specific situation presents imminent danger or threat to students or other members of the community, or requires an immediate need for information in order to avert or diffuse serious threats to the safety or health of a student or other individuals.” 83 “In making [this] determination”, FERPA goes on to say, “an educational agency or institution may take into account the totality of the circumstances pertaining to a threat to the health or safety of a student or other individuals. If the educational agency or institution determines that there is an articulable and significant threat to the health or safety of a student or other individuals, it may disclose information from education records to any person whose knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals. If, based on the information available at the time of the determination, there is a rational basis for the determination, the Department will not substitute its judgment for that of the educational agency or institution in evaluating the circumstances and making its determination.” 84 Providers also should consult their ethical and licensing rules for applicable guidance, such as guidance on when the Tarasoff duty to warn may apply. HIPAA/CMIA : If the records are subject to HIPAA and CMIA, yes. Under California’s Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act , mandated reporters 85 of child abuse must make a report to child protective services or law enforcement whenever they have knowledge of or observe a child in their professional capacity whom they know or reasonably suspect has been the victim of  child abuse or neglect. 86 If information protected   by HIPAA and CMIA is relevant to making that report, the information still must be disclosed to CPS or law enforcement. 87 This does not mean that the information loses its confidentiality protections. While relevant information must be disclosed to CPS or law enforcement, disclosure to anyone else or for any other reason still must comply with HIPAA and CMIA. FERPA : If the records are subject to FERPA, yes. Under California’s Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act , mandated reporters 88 of child abuse must make a report to child protective services or law enforcement whenever they have knowledge of or observe a child in their professional capacity whom they know or reasonably suspect has been the victim of child abuse or neglect. 89 If information protected by FERPA is relevant to making that report, the information still must be disclosed to CPS or law enforcement. This does not mean that the information loses its confidentiality protections. While relevant information must be disclosed to CPS or law enforcement, disclosure to anyone else or for any other reason still must comply with FERPA. HIPAA/CMIA : When information is subject to HIPAA and CMIA, parents generally have a right to inspect their minor child’s health and mental health records when the parents consented to the care. 66 However, there are exceptions. A few such exceptions are listed here: Depending on the types of services provided by a clinic or provider, other laws also may apply and impact confidentiality rules. It is important to consult legal counsel regarding other applicable laws and exceptions. FERPA : When health information is part of an education record subject to FERPA, FERPA says that parents of a student under age 18 may access their child’s education record. 70 “Parent” includes a parent, guardian or person acting in the role of parent. 71 The only exception is if a court order explicitly limits a parent’s right to access the record. In California, each school district is required to have procedures in place to grant requests by parents to access student records. Schools must provide access to student records no later than five business days after the date of the request, not including some school breaks. 72 If a school believes the release of information may put a student at risk, then the school should contact school district legal counsel for advice before any release. It is also important to remember that certain educational counseling records do not become part of an education record and are not subject to FERPA. (For more information, see “What is “educational counseling” and what confidentiality rules apply to educational counseling records?”) In these cases, parents may not be able to access certain educational counseling records. <h2>Minor Consent Questions</h2> Yes. The same consent rules apply whether the services are provided on or off campus and whether the records created are subject to HIPAA or FERPA confidentiality laws. Under California law, minors 12 and older may also consent to mental health counseling, and certain other services, in many cases. A clinic or school cannot adopt a policy that requires obtaining parent consent for these services, as such a policy would conflict with state constitutional and statutory law. (See California Minor Consent Laws ). State law requires school officials to excuse students from school to attend confidential medical appointments. Confidential appointments are appointments to receive services that minors can obtain on their own consent under state or federal law. This includes the mental health and sexual and reproductive health services described in California Minor Consent Laws . The school cannot require that the student have parent or guardian consent in order to attend the appointment and cannot notify parents or guardians when students choose to leave for an appointment during the school day. 128 For more information on confidential medical release, including implementation and documentation of absences, please see National Center for Youth Law’s “ Confidential Medical Release: Frequently Asked Questions from Schools and Districts ”. If a school-based provider is subject to FERPA, the provider cannot promise that a parent will not be able to access SRH information documented in the education file. Providers subject to HIPAA and CMIA, however, must provide minor patients additional confidentiality protections. For some students, this guarantee of confidentiality is critical. These students may choose not to access needed care if confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. In these cases, the provider whose records are subject to FERPA may wish to consider referring the student to a provider operating under HIPAA, and confidential medical release is one mechanism the student can use to make such an appointment possible.", "modified": "2025-09-17T18:08:38", "slug": "mental-health-provider-records-subject-to-ferpa", "status": "publish", "excerpt": "Many substance use providers are subject to additional federal regulations and therefore this section would not apply to them Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) Questions FERPA Specific Questions Sharing and Disclosure Questions for both HIPAA & FERPA Behavioral Health Providers Minor Consent Questions", "document_uuid": "4120ce99-7848-5da2-9434-d33a421b38a6", "document_parent_uuid": "ed0d80ce-c7ed-5f41-8fe4-edbd4e62d355"}

Thus, while a school nurse may maintain a separate file as a means to limit accidental disclosures, the file still would be subject to FERPA in most cases. There are two types of records that are not considered part of an education record, though, and would not be subject to FERPA: Whether either of these two exceptions applies is something to address with legal counsel. <h2>Sharing and Disclosure Questions for both HIPAA & FERPA Medical Providers</h2> HIPAA/Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) : If the provider’s records are subject to HIPAA/CMIA, then the provider can share information pursuant to a HIPAA/CMIA-compliant signed authorization.

A provider may share if a HIPAA/CMIA-compliant authorization is in place. (See Requirements for Release of Information Forms ) In addition, both HIPAA and California law allow a health care provider to share a patient’s medical information with another health care provider “for purposes of diagnosis or treatment of the patient.” 73 This exception allows but does not require disclosure. Other rules, such as ethical guidelines or clinic policy, may also limit a provider’s choice to use this exception. And, HIPAA limits providers from sharing psychotherapy notes without written client authorization. 74 Under California law, “medical information” is defined as ““any individually identifiable information, in electronic or physical form, in possession of or derived from a provider of health care, health care service plan, pharmaceutical company, or contractor regarding a patient’s medical history, mental or physical condition, or treatment.” 75 FERPA : When the information is in a pupil file subject to FERPA, yes, if a FERPA-compliant authorization to release information is in place. (See Requirements for Release of Information Forms ) If there is no authorization in place, information can only be disclosed in a few limited circumstances. For example, the school could provide the health care provider access to directory information about a specific student absent parental consent. What that would include will depend on how directory information has been defined by that school district in its annual notice to parents and whether parents have opted out. In addition, the school nurse also may disclose to the pediatrician information that is not contained in the education record, such as information from oral communications or personal observations that have not been recorded, as long as the disclosure does not violate professional codes of conduct or contractual obligations. 96 In an emergency, the information in the education record may be disclosed to appropriate persons pursuant to the emergency exception, described below in “May a health care provider disclose protected health information in an emergency?”. HIPAA/CMIA : If the records are subject to HIPAA/CMIA, they may be shared in some cases. The information may be disclosed pursuant to a valid HIPAA/CMIA-compliant written authorization. Alternatively, HIPAA and California law also permit health care providers to disclose protected health information to other health care providers for “treatment” purposes. HIPAA defines “treatment” broadly in this context to include coordination or management of health care, consultation, and referral as well as direct treatment. 94 Health care providers also are allowed to disclose information to other providers even without authorization in a few other circumstances, such as in certain medical emergencies (described below in “May a health care provider disclose protected health information in an emergency?”). It is important to note that once disclosed to the school nurse, if the school nurse places the information in the pupil file, FERPA likely will apply when determining access to the information in the file, not HIPAA. 95 This means that information that was once protected under HIPAA may lose those protections once it is placed in a student’s education file.

The same consent rules apply whether the services are provided on or off campus and whether the records created are subject to HIPAA or FERPA confidentiality laws. Under California consent law, minors may consent to certain health care on their own. A clinic or school cannot adopt a policy that requires obtaining parent consent for these services, as such a policy would conflict with state constitutional and statutory law. (See California Minor Consent Laws ). State law requires school officials to excuse students from school to attend confidential medical appointments. Confidential appointments are appointments to receive services that minors can obtain on their own consent under state or federal law. This includes the mental health and sexual and reproductive health services described in California Minor Consent Laws . The school cannot require that the student have parent or guardian consent in order to attend the appointment and cannot notify parents or guardians when students choose to leave for an appointment during the school day. 128 For more information on confidential medical release, including implementation and documentation of absences, please see National Center for Youth Law’s Confidential Medical Release: Frequently Asked Questions from Schools and Districts . If a school-based provider is subject to FERPA, the provider cannot promise that a parent will not be able to access SRH information documented in the education file. Providers subject to HIPAA and CMIA, however, must provide minor patients additional confidentiality protections. For some students, this guarantee of confidentiality is critical. These students may choose not to access needed care if confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. In these cases, the provider whose records are subject to FERPA may wish to consider referring the student to a provider operating under HIPAA, and confidential medical release is one mechanism the student can use to make such an appointment possible.

The information can always be disclosed with parent consent. Absent parent consent, FERPA permits a school to disclose information in the education record to other school officials as long as they have a legitimate educational interest in the information. 110 FERPA requires schools to include in their annual notices to parents a statement indicating whether the school has a policy of disclosing information from the education file to school officials, and, if so, which parties are considered school officials for this purpose and what the school considers to be a “legitimate educational interest.” 111 Thus, the school may share the information with the school nurse or counselor if the nurse or counselor has a legitimate educational reason in needing the information, as legitimate educational interest is defined by the district. 112 In addition, FERPA authorizes disclosures to “appropriate parties” if “knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals” 113 in response to a specific situation that poses an imminent danger. The release may occur “if the agency or institution determines, on a case-by-case basis, that a specific situation presents imminent danger or threat to students or other members of the community, or requires an immediate need for information in order to avert or diffuse serious threats to the safety or health of a student or other individuals.” 114 The school-based provider  will  be required to protect the information subject to FERPA. 115 It depends. The information can always be disclosed with parent consent. Absent parent consent, FERPA permits a school to disclose information in the education record to other school officials as long as they have a legitimate educational interest in the information. 116 FERPA requires schools to include in their annual notices to parents a statement indicating whether the school has a policy of disclosing information from the education file to school officials, and, if so, which parties are considered school officials for this purpose and what the school considers to be a “legitimate educational interest.” 117 Thus, the school nurse may  share the information with  the  teacher  if the teacher has a legitimate educational reason in needing the information, as legitimate educational interest is defined by the district. 118 In addition, FERPA authorizes disclosures to “appropriate parties” if “knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals” 119 in response to a specific situation that poses an imminent danger. The release may occur “if the agency or institution determines, on a case-by-case basis, that a specific situation presents imminent danger or threat to students or other members of the community, or requires an immediate need for information in order to avert or diffuse serious threats to the safety or health of a student or other individuals.” 120 It depends. The information can always be disclosed with FERPA-compliant parent consent. If there is no consent in place, the information can be shared in some cases depending on the contractor’s role and the services being provided. According to guidance from the U.S. Department of Education, “agencies and institutions subject to FERPA are not precluded from disclosing education records to parties to whom they have outsourced services so long as they do so under the same conditions applicable to school officials who are actually employed.” The guidance reminds schools and educational agencies that “an educational agency or institution may not disclose education records without prior written consent merely because it has entered into a contract or agreement with an outside party. Rather, the agency or institution must be able to show that 1) the outside party provides a service for the agency or institution that it would otherwise provide for itself using employees; 2) the outside party would have “legitimate educational interests” in the information disclosed if the service were performed by employees; and 3) the outside party is under the direct control of the educational agency or institution with respect to the use and maintenance of information from educational records.” Examples of services that a district would otherwise use an employee to perform but may be contracted to a vendor include legal services, student transportation, school nursing, and online data systems. The guidance reminds districts that they remain completely responsible for their contractor’s compliance with FERPA requirements in these situations and states “[f]or that reason, we recommend that these specific protections be incorporated into any contract or  agreement  between an educational agency or institution and any non-employees it retains to provide institutional services.” The U.S. Department of Education adds that if the school has not “listed contractors and other outside service providers as ‘school officials’ in its annual §99.7 FERPA notification, then it is required to record each disclosure to a qualifying contractor in accordance with § 99.32(a).” 121 Yes, but only with a signed FERPA-compliant release or in an emergency. Disclosure of information in the education file about a student’s  chronic conditions to a provider operating under HIPAA is permitted under a FERPA-compliant release. In addition, information from the education record may be disclosed to protect the health or safety of a student or other individual. 122 However, this exception has been strictly interpreted by the U.S. Department of Education. The emergency must be a specific situation that requires immediate need for disclosure of the information. Thus, for example, the emergency exception could not be used to send a list of all students with asthma or diabetes to the school-based health center; however, the exception could be used by the school to provide information to a health provider about a specific student with asthma who is having acute symptoms and needs immediate intervention. It depends. If a school nurse, or another health provider subject to FERPA, documents minor consent information, this becomes part of the education file and is subject to FERPA. Information in the education file of a student 18 and younger can always be disclosed to the principal with parent consent. Absent parent consent, FERPA permits a school to disclose information in the education record to other school officials as long as the school official has a legitimate educational interest in the information. 124 A principal is a school official, but the principal can only access the information if the principal has a legitimate educational interest in the information. FERPA requires schools to include in their annual notices to parents a statement indicating whether the school has a policy of disclosing information from the education file to school officials, and, if so, which parties are considered school officials for this purpose and what the school considers to be a “legitimate educational interest.” 125 In limited circumstances, yes. The information may be disclosed pursuant to a FERPA compliant written authorization. If there is no authorization in place, information can only be disclosed in a few limited circumstances. For example, the school could provide the health provider access to directory information about a specific student absent parent consent. What that would include will depend on how directory information has been defined by that school district in its annual notice to parents and whether parents have opted out. In addition, the school also may disclose information to the provider that is not contained in the education record, such as information from oral communications or personal observation that have not been recorded. 129 In an emergency, the information in the education record may be disclosed to appropriate persons pursuant to the FERPA emergency exception described in School Nurses Frequently Asked Questions: May a school nurse disclose information from the education record in an emergency? . HIPAA / Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) : If the provider’s records are subject to HIPAA/CMIA, then the provider can share information pursuant to a HIPAA/CMIA-compliant signed authorization. Otherwise, there is no exception under HIPAA that would allow a provider to share protected health information with a teacher for this purpose. FERPA : If the records are subject to FERPA, yes in several situations. The provider can release if a FERPA-compliant release form is in place. In addition, an exception in FERPA allows school staff to share information with “school officials” in the same educational agency who have a “legitimate educational interest” in the information. The term “school official” includes school staff, such as teachers, counselors, principals, and school nurses. A school or district may define this term more broadly in its school policies so that it also includes outside consultants, contractors   or volunteers to whom a school has outsourced a school function if certain conditions are met. 76 The school official must have a “legitimate educational interest” in the information. This phrase has been defined to mean that the school official needs the information to perform his or her official duties. 77 FERPA requires schools to include in their annual notices to parents a statement indicating whether the school has a policy of disclosing information from the education file to school officials, and, if so, which parties are considered school officials for this purpose and what the school considers to be a “legitimate educational interest.” 78 This guidance is for information purposes only.

{"page_id": 3368, "title": "Excerpts from the California Education Code and the California Health and Safety Code", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/excerpts-ca-ed-code-health-safety-code/", "content": "School boards and county superintendents of schools are to maintain fundamental school health services at a level that preserves students’ ability to learn, fulfills existing state student health requirements and policies, and contains health care costs through preventive programs and education. The legislature also recognizes that the current caseloads in public schools may be jeopardizing the provision of these services and that failure to maintain them at an adequate level may result in students’ poorer health and ability to learn. Assembly Bill 1667 (AB 1667) amended Section 49423.5 of the California Education Code, which permits individuals with exceptional needs requiring specialized physical health care services, including catheterization, gastric tube feeding, suctioning or other services, to be assisted by certain specified individuals. AB 1667 amends this provision to provide that specialized physical health care services may be provided by qualified designated school personnel under the supervision, as defined by Section 3051.12 of Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations, of a credentialed school nurse or licensed physician or surgeon upon determination, in consultation with the treating physician, that the services meet all of the following specified requirements: These qualified designated personnel must be trained in CPR and be knowledgeable of the emergency medical resources in the community. AB 1667 also provides that nothing in the amendment will cause the placement of individuals with exceptional needs at school sites other than those they would have attended but for their needs for specialized physical health care services. Law Section 56324(b) Any health assessment of pupils shall be made in accordance with Section 56320 and shall be  conducted by a credentialed school nurse or physician who is trained and prepared to assess cultural   and ethnic factors appropriate to the pupil being assessed. The Office of Administrative Hearings State of California Case number 2024110856 ruling on Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) and student health assessments, confirmed the assessments must be conducted by a credentialed school nurse or physician as noted in EC 56324(b) Law Section #: EC49423 – EC49423.1 Any student that is required to take prescribed medication during the regular school day may be assisted by a school nurse or designated school personnel. In order for the student to be assisted, the school district shall receive a written statement from the student’s doctor with the medication name, amount used, method and schedule of administration, together with a written statement from the parent, foster parent, or guardian requesting that the school assist the student according to the doctor’s instructions. A student may also carry and self-administer prescribed auto-injectable epinephrine or inhaled asthma medication if the school district obtains a written statement from the student’s doctor with (a) the medication name, amount used, method and schedule of administration; (b) a written confirmation that the student is able to self-administer the medication; (c) a statement from the parent, foster parent, or guardian providing a release to designated school personnel to consult with the student’s health care provider regarding taking the medication; and (d) a release of the school district and personnel from civil liability related to any adverse reaction to the self-administered medication. A student may be subject to disciplinary action if the medication is used in any manner other than prescribed. The above statements shall be provided annually or when the medication or administration of a medication changes. The parent/guardian of any student in the public schools may file annually with the principal, a written, signed statement denying consent for the child to undergo a physical examination, and the child will thereupon be exempt from such examinations. However, if there is reason to believe that the child has an infectious or contagious disease, the child will be sent home and not permitted to return to school until school authorities are satisfied that the child does not have a contagious or infectious disease. School boards may provide for sight and hearing testing of students in their districts. School boards may provide for the scoliosis screening of every female student in grade 7 and every male student in grade 8. Specifications regarding reexamination, notification of results, and liability immunity are described. Every child in a California elementary school is to have his or her vision appraised by the school nurse at least every third year until the completion of the eighth grade. Color vision, however, shall go in the child’s health record. The evaluation may be waived if the child’s parents desire and if they document that a physician or optometrist has already done the appraisal and provides the appropriate results. Also, the testing is not to be done if the parent/guardian has indicated in writing that such testing violates the parent’s religious beliefs. If a problem has been noted, a report will be made to the parent/guardian, along with a request that corrective action be taken. Reporting and referral specifications are described. All students enrolled in kindergarten or first grade (if not previously enrolled in kindergarten) must provide proof of having received an oral health assessment (dental exam) by a licensed dentist or dental health professional, that was performed no earlier than 12 months prior to the date of initial enrollment of the student. The proof must be presented no later than May 31 of the school year. Districts must inform parents and guardians of this requirement, give contact information for government-subsidized health insurance and county public health departments, and highlight the importance of oral health. Parents or guardians may request a waiver from this requirement for the following reasons: School districts will require full immunization for admission to any private or public elementary or secondary school, child care center, day nursery, nursery school, family day care home, or development center. Districts will conditionally admit a student unless prior to his or her first admission s/he has been fully immunized. The following are the diseases for which full immunization shall be required for unconditional school admission: Exceptions Conditional Admission School districts may admit a student on condition that within time periods designated by regulation of CDHS, s/he presents evidence that they s/he haves been fully immunized against these diseases. If a conditionally admitted student fails to meet immunization requirements within the indicated time period, s/he may be excluded from school. Exemptions from immunization are allowed for medical reasons, as documented by a licensed physician, or because of personal beliefs, with a signed affidavit from the parent or guardian. Districts must notify parents and guardians of immunization requirements, maintain immunization records on all students, and report district immunization data to CDHS and the local health department(s). If there is good cause to believe that a child has been exposed to a disease listed in subdivision (b) of Section 120335 and the child’s documentary proof of immunization status does not show proof of immunization against that disease, that child may be temporarily excluded from the school or institution until the local health officer is satisfied that the child is no longer at risk of developing or transmitting the disease. (a) Pupils in the state are advised, as described in subdivision to adhere to current immunization guidelines, as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, regarding full human papillomavirus (HPV) immunization before admission or advancement to the eighth grade level of any private or public elementary or secondary school. (b) Upon a pupil’s admission or advancement to the sixth grade level, the governing authority of any private or public elementary or secondary school shall submit to the pupil and their parent or guardian a notification containing a statement about the state’s public policy described in subdivision (a) and advising that the pupil adhere to current HPV immunization guidelines, as described in subdivision (a), before admission or advancement to the eighth grade level, in compliance with the notification requirements of Article 4 (commencing with Section 48980) of Chapter 6 of Part 27 of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code. (c) The notification sent pursuant to subdivision (b) shall also include a statement, as determined by the department, summarizing the recommended ages for the HPV vaccine and scientific rationale for vaccination at those ages, based on guidance issued by ACIP of the CDC, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians. The notification shall further state the following: “HPV vaccination can prevent over 90 percent of cancers caused by HPV. HPV vaccines are very safe, and scientific research shows that the benefits of HPV vaccination far outweigh the potential risks.” (d) This section does not apply to a pupil in a home-based private school. No school district, officer of any school district, school principal, physician, or hospital treating any student will be held liable for the reasonable treatment of the child without the consent of the child’s parent/guardian when the child is ill or injured during regular school hours, requires reasonable medical treatment, and the parent/guardian cannot be reached, unless the parent/guardian has filed a written objection to medical treatment other than first aid.

Nationwide, low-income children and adolescents are less likely than their wealthier peers to have been fully immunized. 1 In California, more than 8% of children arrive at kindergarten without all required vaccines, and only 42% of children and adolescents are immunized against the flu in any given year. 2 The rates of other essential vaccinations–including human papillomavirus, meningococcal meningitis, and pertussis/whooping cough–are also too low. As a result, children and adolescents catch, suffer from, and pass on dangerous preventable illnesses. <h2>School-Located Vaccination Increases Immunization Rates</h2> School-located vaccination (SLV) programs and school-based health centers (SBHCs) improve adolescent vaccination rates, while simultaneously saving health care dollars for society. More specifically, recent research shows that: <h3>Back-to-School Vaccinations</h3> The California School Immunization Law requires that children receive a series of immunizations before entry to schools, child care centers, and family child care homes. The law also requires schools, child care centers, and family child care homes to enforce immunization requirements, maintain immunization records, and submit reports. Learn more by visiting the California Department of Public Health’s (CDPH) Immunization Branch . The CDPH Office of School Health also has helpful information. <h3>Find More Information</h3> California Immuniza tion Coalition California Immunization Registry EZIZ Vaccine Information Statements in Multiple Languages <h2>Schools & School-Located Vaccination Clinics Can Stop Flu Spreading</h2> According the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, schools can play a critical role in: SBHCs can run school-located vaccination (SLV) clinics. Research shows that SLV can be an effective way to increase immunization rates. 5,6,7 SLV also makes sense financially: rigorous cost-benefit analysis shows that school-based influenza vaccination programs pay for themselves by the end of the flu season’s “peak week,” and, over the course of an entire flu season, save society money by preventing illness. 8 <h4>Flu Prevention & Treatment</h4> SBHCs should provide seasonal flu vaccine. The CDC has recently expanded the recommended ages for influenza vaccination of children to include all children aged six months through 18 years. <h2>Additional Vaccine Information</h2> <h3>HPV Vaccination</h3> As of January 1, 2024, the Cancer Prevention Act, Assembly Bill 659 (Aguiar-Curry, 2023), became law in the state of California, promoting the HPV (Human Papillomavirus) vaccination to prevent cancers.  The act requires schools to notify 6th-grade students and their parents/guardians to follow HPV immunization guidelines before starting 8th grade. The CDPH provides more information and guidance on vaccine protocols for minor consent . <h3>Tdap Immunization Requirement</h3> All students entering or advancing to grades 7 through 12 are required to be immunized with a pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine booster called Tdap. SBHCs can play a lead role in ensuring all targeted students in their school district have received the Tdap booster on or after their 7th birthday, and that they have submitted the required proof to their school. Learn more about Tdap vaccines by visiting the CDPH’s Pertussis (Whooping Cough) web page . <h2>Key Steps for Providers</h2> Take these steps to ensure adolescent patients are protected against pertussis and are ready for school entry: (1) Child Trends Data Bank: http://www.childtrendsdatabank.org/?q=node/71 .

It is more common than asthma or obesity among children, and yet it is entirely preventable. In California, more than 60% of children aged 6 to 19 are affected by tooth decay 1 . When left untreated, it can cause pain, difficulty eating, and trouble speaking, all of which can hinder a child’s intellectual and social development 2 . These issues contribute to significant school absenteeism, with an estimated 869,202 missed school days annually, costing school districts approximately $60 million each year 3 . <h2>Children’s Oral Health Matters for School Success</h2> Explore the latest data on how oral health impacts school attendance and academic performance among children in California. <h2>Working Together for Student Oral Health</h2> Schools provide an ideal setting where health and education come together to support early intervention and prevention. School dental programs offer a range of dental services designed to keep students healthy and ready to learn by emphasizing prevention and implementing strategies that connect them to a dental home. These early habits, such as regular dental visits and good oral hygiene, can continue into adulthood as part of a lifelong commitment to oral health. School dental programs, integrated into school-based health centers, are essential for protecting children’s overall health, academic success, and lifelong well-being. Elements of a School-based/School-linked Dental Program <h2>Kindergarten Oral Health Assessment (KOHA)</h2> California State Requirements The Kindergarten Oral Health Assessment (KOHA) law ( Education Code Section 49452.8 ) mandates oral health screenings for children in their first year of public school in transitional kindergarten (TK), kindergarten, or first grade. TK students who receive a screening do not need to repeat it in kindergarten or first grade, though regular dental care is recommended for overall health and school success. School districts and/or county of education must collect and submit KOHA data annually to the County Office of Education using the System for California Oral Health Reporting (SCOHR). Passive consent is allowed, meaning children are screened unless their parents opt out. Important Deadlines Oral Health Assessment Resources KOHA forms are available in Spanish, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Korean, Tagalog and Vietnamese.  <h2>Dental Sealants & Fluoride Varnish</h2> Scientific evidence supports the effectiveness of fluoride varnish and dental sealants at reducing dental caries (cavities). Both are quick and painless to apply. Children experience the greatest benefit when both preventive services are used together. What Works Best, When? *Completion of fluoride varnish training is required Sealants reduce the risk of cavities by up to 80%. Children without sealants are three times more likely to develop cavities in their first molars 5 . Similarly, fluoride varnish can prevent about 33% of cavities in primary (baby) teeth 6 . Both services are covered by Medi-Cal Dental. Image 1: Toothbrush bristles cannot effectively reach pits and fissures, leaving them prone to decay Image 2: Sealant forms a protective barrier, blocking food and bacteria Image 3: Fluoride varnish being applied to the tooth surface Programs that deliver sealants to children at high risk for tooth decay save money. Each tooth sealed saves more than $11 in dental treatment costs. School Dental Sealant & Fluoride Varnish Program Resources <h2>Connecting Children to a Dental Home</h2> A dental home is an ongoing relationship with a dental provider that ensures comprehensive, coordinated care 7 . Regular dental visits keep children healthy and help prevent emergency department visits, which only offer temporary relief. Children eligible for Medi-Cal are also eligible for Medi-Cal Dental , which covers the following dental services for children : To connect students with urgent dental needs, school nurses and staff can fill out the Dental Care Coordination Referral Form for Medi-Cal members.

The California Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI) received $338 million through Children & Youth Behavioral Health Initiative (CYBHI) to design and build the CWC workforce. The CWC role was developed to increase California’s overall capacity to support the growing behavioral health needs of the state’s children and youth. An important aspect of this initiative is bringing more supportive adults into schools who better represent and have more shared lived experiences with the vibrantly diverse backgrounds and experiences of California’s children and youth— providers who children and youth can connect with, who speak their language, and understand their communities. Currently, there are limited employment opportunities in the behavioral health workforce for individuals who do not have an advanced degree. The CWC role is meant to fill in some of this gap and provide both a desirable occupation as well as a stepping stone for those that want to continue on to a more advanced behavioral health role, such as becoming a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) or Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT). <h2>Two Pathways to Becoming a CWC</h2> Depending on the level of education achieved, there will be two classifications: Both pathways require field experience hours to become certified, ranging from 400-2,700 hours. HCAI is working with state universities as well as community colleges to develop the CWC  training program. <h2>Services & Competences of the Certified Wellness Coach</h2> Potential activities of CWCs in a school-based health and wellness center might include: <h3>Wellness Promotion & Education</h3> Deliver classroom sessions on SEL, mindfulness, stress reduction, substance use prevention, and suicide awareness. Lead campus-wide wellness events and stigma reduction efforts. Build relationships with students, staff, and families, and serve as a visible wellness champion. <h3>Screening</h3> Support universal and targeted mental health screenings. Triage students for Tier 2 or 3 interventions and connect them to appropriate in-school or SBHC services. Use screening data to guide schoolwide wellness activities. <h3>Care Coordination</h3> Assist with case management, external referrals, and access to basic needs. Help families navigate Medi-Cal enrollment and re-certification. Collaborate with school staff and providers to ensure coordinated, culturally responsive support. <h3>Individual Support</h3> Provide drop-in check-ins and 1:1 support on mental health, relationships, and coping strategies. Identify students needing higher-level care and offer warm hand-offs. Use tools like motivational interviewing and non-clinical assessments to guide care. <h3>Group Support</h3> Facilitate non-clinical groups focused on skills like mindfulness, anger management, and stress relief. Lead culturally specific or peer-led groups, and collaborate with SBHC providers on therapeutic groups. Support peer mentoring and student leadership. <h3>Crisis Referral</h3> Join school crisis response teams and help lead healing efforts after crises, including circles and school-wide activities. Trained in Youth Mental Health First Aid and QPR for early intervention and referral. <h2>Sustainability</h2> Some Certified Wellness Coach services are reimbursable under the CYBHI Fee Schedule program. Additionally, Certified Wellness Coach Services are now approved as a new Medi-Cal benefit via State Plan Amendment (SPA) 25-0014, with an effective date retroactive to January 1, 2025. While not all activities performed by a CWC will be reimbursable, this billing can provide potential revenue to help support these Certified Wellness Coach positions into the future. Guidance is still pending on the claims process for FQHCs and Rural and Tribal Health Centers. However, these health centers can provide CWC services as a carved-out service and receive supplemental reimbursement at the Fee-for-Service (FFS) rate.

It does this by establishing a standard set of school-based or school-linked behavioral health services that all health plans, including Medi-Cal and commercial insurers, are required to reimburse. This is a major step forward, as many schools and their partner organizations already provide these critical services but often receive no reimbursement. The CYBHI fee schedule creates a powerful opportunity to tap into ongoing, sustainable funding to strengthen and expand school-based behavioral health supports. <h2>Video: Introduction to the CYBHI Fee Schedule</h2> The Department of Health Care Services has released the CYBHI Fee Schedule: Scope of Services, Codes, and Reimbursement Rates . This document outlines in detail which services are covered, the specific procedure codes to use, the types of eligible practitioners, and the reimbursement rates for each service. The services covered under the CYBHI Fee Schedule fall into four main categories: The expanded scope of billable services means that schools and their partners may now receive reimbursement for activities such as screenings, prevention, and case management—services that previously were not often reimbursed. Importantly, the Fee Schedule also allows practitioners who haven’t historically billed for services to general education students —such as school social workers, counselors, and non-licensed practitioners —to now submit claims and receive reimbursement for eligible services. <h2>See Guidance for the Participation of LEAs</h2> From the Department of Health Care Services Community partner organizations, such as school-based health centers and wellness centers, community based organizations, and clinics can participate in the Fee Schedule by becoming an Affiliated Provider, designated by the local educational agency (LEA). There are three participation pathways for community based school-linked providers to participate. They include: <h2>See Guidance for the Participation of Community Providers</h2> From the California Department of Health Care Services <h2>CYBHI Fee Schedule vs LEA BOP Billing</h2> The CYBHI Fee Schedule differs from the Local Educational Agency Medi-Cal Billing Option Program (LEA BOP) in a few key ways. The Fee Schedule covers both Medi-Cal enrolled and commercially insured students. The fee schedule reimburses both the federal and the state share, the LEA receives a straight fee-for-service rate rather than an interim payment with later cost settlement, and the Fee Schedule does not require a Random Moment in Time Study. However, the CYBHI Fee Schedule only covers behavioral health related services, while LEA BOP allows for billing for a broad range of health-related services.

One of the greatest risks facing youth who use opioids is that deaths from fentanyl – an extremely potent opioid – more than quadrupled in California between 2014 and 2017. Early evidence supports the notion of a pending “wave” as fentanyl enters more and broader pockets of the drug supply. Deaths are increasingly seen among individuals using substances other than opioids, including marijuana, that are laced with fentanyl. <h2>Youth & OUD</h2> The adolescent brain is uniquely primed for substance use disorder (SUD), including OUD. Biologically, youth are at greater risk of initiating substance use and progressing to OUD. Adolescent substance use is also highly predictive of adult substance use because the adolescent brain is still developing, making it more susceptible to addiction. Nine out of ten people meeting the clinical criteria for a SUD began using addictive substances before the age of 18. 6 At the same time, youth are at higher risk of experiencing more severe short- and long-term harms of substance use. The developing adolescent brain puts youth at greater risk of substance use because: <h2>Treating Youth with OUD</h2> OUD is a chronic disease. It can be treated with both medical and psychosocial interventions and often requires long term, sometimes lifelong, management. Relapse is common because cravings for opioids can persist for years; in relapse, risk of death is often higher as tolerance to opioids may be reduced. Research shows that youth with OUD face higher risks than youth with other SUDs. They are more likely to use intravenous drugs, have more depressive symptoms, higher academic impairment, riskier sexual behavior, and a poorer long-term prognosis. 7 Most substance use concerns arise during adolescence, yet less than 10 percent of youth receive the treatment they need. The reasons why youth do not receive treatment can vary. The first step to determine if a young person has an SUD or OUD is screening. <h2>Download a Printable Guide</h2> 1.

{"page_id": 2558, "title": "Funding School-Based Health &amp; Wellness Centers", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/funding/", "content": "School-based health centers and wellness centers (SBHC/WCs) are tailored to the unique needs of each school community. Their services, operations, and funding structures vary depending on the lead agency, available resources, and strength of school and community partnerships. There is no single or dedicated state funding stream for SBHC/WCs in California. Instead, these centers rely on a mix of public and private funding, requiring creative and strategic collaboration. <h2>Partnerships</h2> Different partners often have access to different funding sources. For example: Because of this, strong partnerships between school districts, health providers, and community organizations are essential to launch and sustain SBHC/WCs. These collaborations help align funding sources with shared goals for student health and well-being. One of the most effective ways to fund school health services is by partnering with local health providers—such as clinics, hospitals, or county health departments. Each partner can contribute different services: for example, a children’s hospital might provide primary care, a nonprofit might offer mental health counseling, and a dentist could deliver screenings. Ideally, these services are provided on campus at no cost to the school, with providers covering expenses through Medi-Cal reimbursements or grants. Schools can support these partnerships by promoting services to students and families, helping with enrollment, providing space, making referrals, and coordinating services when possible. <h2>Creating Space for School-Based Health Centers & Wellness Centers</h2> Launching a school-based health or wellness center usually starts with identifying a suitable space and assessing any renovation or construction needs. While some centers require major capital investment, many are established through cost-effective upgrades to existing facilities. SBHCs/WCs can be housed in a variety of settings, including: Funding for facility development is often assembled from a mix of local, state, and federal sources. Common options include: With strategic use of these resources, schools and their partners can create welcoming, functional spaces to support student health and wellness. <h2>Key State Funding Opportunities</h2> These include: Full-Service Community Schools – For pre-K–12 schools using a whole-child approach that integrates academics, health services, youth development, and community engagement. Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative (CYBHI) – A $4.7 billion initiative to transform behavioral health systems for youth ages 0–25, including: Behavioral Health Services Act – Funds partnerships between county mental health agencies and LEAs to deliver school-based mental health services, with a focus on prevention and early intervention. CalAIM (California Advancing and Innovating Medi-Cal) initiatives , such as Enhanced Care Management (ECM) and Community Supports (CS) –  designed to support students and families enrolled in MediCal with complex needs. <h2>See Our Guide for Braided Funding</h2> <h2>Third-Party Reimbursement for School-Based Health and Wellness Centers</h2> School-based health and wellness centers run by community partners such as community clinics, hospitals, and other licensed health care providers can bill public and private health insurance programs for many of services. These include: School-based health and wellness centers operated by school districts or LEAs can also bill for a range of services provided to Medi-Cal-enrolled students through the following programs: While billing and reimbursement can be administratively complex, it is one of the most important strategies for sustaining and expanding school health services. Centers that are able to capture third-party revenue can stretch grant funding further, grow services, and reach more students. <h2>See Our Third-Party Billing Guide</h2> <h2>Grant Funding & Additional Support</h2> Sustaining a school-based health center or wellness center takes more than billing insurance. In fact, most centers can’t rely on third-party reimbursement alone.  Strong programs often offer vital services that may not be reimbursable — like student outreach, classroom education, peer health programs, health fairs, food distribution, and staff wellness initiatives. Even some clinical care may not be covered due to gaps in insurance, lack of medical necessity, or other barriers. That’s why grant funding plays a crucial role in keeping centers running. Ideally, a portion of this support is unrestricted and recurring — covering core operations like administration and management. Local health departments or hospital community benefit programs are potential sources of such funding. More commonly, however, school-based health centers rely on a patchwork of short-term, project-specific grants from foundations or government agencies. These often focus on targeted issues such as tobacco prevention, asthma management, trauma screening, or teen pregnancy prevention. To thrive, school-based health centers and wellness centers should take a creative, strengths-based approach to grant seeking. Even when funding is framed around problems, it can be leveraged to build positive, empowering programs that uplift students and their communities. <h2>See Our School Health Billing Guide</h2> <h2>Successful Strategies for Funding SBHC/WCs</h2> <h3>Partner With Community Providers</h3> Riverbank Unified School District partnered with Golden Valley Health Center, a local clinic interested in launching a school-based health center. Together, they secured state and federal funding to open a state-of-the-art clinic serving both students and the community. <h3>Apply for Grants</h3> Oakland and West Contra Costa Unified School Districts supplement their school-based health center funding with grants from Kaiser Permanente’s Community Benefit Program. This is one example of a funder committed to strengthening the health care safety net by increasing access to health services at school. <h3>Work With County Offices of Education</h3> The Fresno County Office of Education seeks federal reimbursement for school-based Medi-Cal Administrative Activities. The County uses that money to pay for a mobile clinic and a nurse practitioner to staff it. The mobile clinic provides needed medical care and immunizations to eight rural school districts. <h3>Fundraise in the Community</h3> Culver City Unified School District holds an annual gala to raise funds for the Sandy Segal Youth Health Center. The district also works with local businesses to put on smaller fundraising events throughout the school year. <h3>Seek County Support Through a Bond Measure</h3> The most financially stable school-based health centers (SBHCs) typically receive consistent “base funding” each year. This funding helps cover essential services that aren’t reimbursed, such as classroom education, care coordination, and services for uninsured students. In Alameda County, a local tax provides all SBHCs with annual base funding and technical support. <h2>Education Funding</h2> Schools can use existing funding to support school health services. For example, districts can choose to use a portion of their Title I-A, LEA BOP Medi-Cal, or Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) dollars to support school health services. In addition, school districts can apply for competitive grant funding to enhance their current resources. Educators and others who support school health services should both seek new funding and urge decision-makers to direct existing funding to health services. As of 2026, all LEAs are eligible to  bill and be reimbursed through the CYBHI Multi-Payer Fee Schedule for a broad range of behavioral health services. School employees such as school social workers, school psychologists, and school counselors will be able to bill Medi-Cal and commercial health plans through a third-party administrator, Carelon Behavioral Health,  for many of the activities that they currently do.  This is a significant ongoing revenue stream for schools and community partners that is still in its infancy, but school districts and partner organizations are beginning to receive reimbursement. <h3>Overview of Key Funding Streams</h3> Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) – California’s funding formula for determining the level of state funding to school districts to provide for their state-supported general and supplemental programs. School districts receive additional resources to meet the unique challenges that face certain targeted student groups (including low income students). These resources must be spent to increase or improve services for targeted students to achieve state and local priorities. Medi-Cal Billing – School districts can bill  Medi-Cal programs for some of the services that they provide. Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative (CYBHI) – delivering behavioral health support for children and youth. Key funding streams are the CYBHI Fee Schedule and Certified Wellness Coaches.

Providing health services in school settings is a sound investment to ensure that students are prepared to learn, develop, and thrive. However, in a 2018 RAND survey, only 11% of school principals in California reported that primary health care services were provided at their schools. Well beyond their legal obligations, schools and their partners are increasingly making strategic investments in providing resources to students to enhance their health and well-being and promote their social and emotional development so they can succeed in the classroom. For more than 50 years, school-based health centers and wellness centers (SBHC/WC) have been one such strategic investment—a model based on placing comprehensive health care services on school campuses, making care accessible and convenient to students where they spend a significant portion of their day. With the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools and SBHC/WCs transitioned to telehealth services as a strategy for meeting student health needs when school campuses were closed. With improved technology, internet access, and a recognition of the importance of school-based health, telehealth has emerged as an opportunity to serve students more widely and equitably. Telehealth options for schools come in varying forms, with some key models described below. Each option presents unique opportunities depending on the school’s population, health care needs, capacity, and financial resources. School telehealth can also be of great value in providing youth-friendly services for children and adolescents who have interacted with technology their entire lives. According to the national School-Based Health Alliance, only 20% of SBHC/WCs used telehealth in 2016- 2017; that figure rose to 89% during the 2020-2021 school year. It is expected that more SBHC/WCs will use telehealth going forward, even post-pandemic, as the integration of technology in health care continues to improve and become ubiquitous. <h2>What Is Telehealth?</h2> Telehealth is the use of telecommunication technologies to provide patient care by delivering clinical services remotely and from a separate location than the patient. Telehealth can provide timelier and improved access to care by allowing patients to receive care from remote providers. It is a logical way to increase the capacity to address the unmet health care needs of many people, and was an especially critical lifeline for many during the COVID pandemic. Although telehealth has historically been primarily used to increase access to specialty care in underserved regions, it can also be used to provide a range of primary and behavioral health services, including care for minor illnesses (e.g., pink eye, rash), primary preventive care (e.g., well child visits), chronic disease management (e.g., asthma), and mental health counseling/support. It is considered a cost-effective alternative to health care that is provided in person, especially for rural and underserved areas. The term telehealth encompasses the following modalities: This page is focused on synchronous telehealth through audio only and audio-video interactions. <h2>Telehealth in Schools</h2> In order to provide telehealth services to students at school, a few basic ingredients are needed: Equipment Personnel Systems *As needed. Some services, such as mental health, may not require some of these components if audio-only telehealth is utilized. <h2>Benefits for Students</h2> Young people are open to—and already using—telehealth to meet their health needs. Schools can meet teens where they are at with the provision of telehealth services. Telehealth has the potential to increase access to primary, specialty, and mental health care for students, particularly marginalized youth that might otherwise go without access to care due to various socioeconomic factors. Transportation barriers are reduced for youth, parents, and guardians. Older adolescents can use telehealth to access sensitive and confidential care independently. Students and families whose primary language is not English may also be able to access more culturally and linguistically appropriate care through telehealth options. Telehealth can also provide access to types of providers and specialists that may not be available in the immediate community. <h3>Studies & Provider Organizations Support Telehealth in Schools</h3> A recent study analyzing one of the largest school-based telehealth programs in the nation, based in Texas, found that such programs have the potential to reach a large pediatric population that need health care due to lapses in services because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Asthma and other respiratory disease was the primary diagnosis, demonstrating that telehealth is a good option for management of chronic conditions. The American Academy of Pediatrics has endorsed the use of school-based telemedicine for chronic childhood disease and for those that live in rural and underserved areas. The National Association of School Nurses also supports the use of telehealth technology to augment school health services, but not replace in-person health provided by the school nurse.  Other studies have demonstrated that students with access to care through telehealth at school show improved health and education outcomes. A 2021 report commissioned by Common Sense, Hopelab and the California Health Care Foundation on how young people use digital media to manage their mental health found that social media and online tools were a lifeline that many young people needed to get through the pandemic.  Nearly half (47%) of those surveyed reported that they had connected with healthcare providers online using digital tools, including more than one in four (27%) engaging in a video appointment with a provider.  The report also revealed that 65% of adolescents ages 14-17 used health-related mobile apps and 85% searched for health information online. <h2>Telehealth Options for Schools</h2> <h3>Hub and Spoke Model</h3> In this model, a school site, SBHC/WC, or community-based site serves as a central location, or “hub,” where clinical providers are located. Patients and presenting staff or providers, or “spokes,” are located at other locations within the collaborating system or district to support students at those sites as they are connected, via telehealth, to the providers in the “hub.” SBHC/WCs can function as both “hubs” and “spokes” as described in the examples below. Example 1: In Hawaii, one pediatrician located at an SBHC/WC serves students at three other schools by having a well-trained medical assistant at the outlying school present student patients to her so that she can conduct a thorough physical exam by telehealth. This allows the physician to order vaccines and lab tests at that visit and the medical assistant to complete them. In this case, telehealth increases access for those schools and also increases the physician’s efficiency by widening the number of students she can reach and generating additional reimbursement for her SBHC/WC, which operates as the hub. Example 2: In West Virginia, a telemental health program was able to increase access to psychiatric services for SBHC/WC patients who did not have access, reducing the wait time for their initial appointments. In this scenario, they set up a receiving station and equip it with appropriate technology such as a camera, computer, and monitor. Another agency then provides mental health care remotely to students who are in the SBHC/WC location and in partnership with the staff and providers there. This example illustrates an SBHC/WC acting as a telehealth spoke to provide specialty care beyond the scope of the SBHC/WC services. Example 3: Denver Public Schools is piloting a full spoke model at a high school campus that includes well-child visits and some reproductive health. It is exploring whether this model increases student access to quality health care services; early results are promising and the district is also considering a full service SBHC/WC. This example illustrates employing a school nurse or a health technician that supports the spoke end of an enhancement model. SBHC/WCs can also use telehealth to extend their services during breaks or when students are not in school. Many SBHC/WCs provided telehealth services to students who were not in school during the COVID-19 public health emergency. A community health center in Oakland that operates eight SBHC/WCs developed a phone triage line for youth in Oakland during the COVID pandemic when schools and SBHC/WCs were closed and conducted hundreds of video, phone and text-based care for student patients. As SBHC/WCs re-opened in the fall of 2021, many transitioned to a “hybrid” model of care with some visits delivered in person and others provided via the now-established telehealth platform. This broadens options for students and allows them choice in managing their own health. It also allows SBHC/WC providers to work from alternative locations as needed, and to reach students who might not be in school. Some SBHC/WCs use telehealth to extend the traditional boundaries of health care, for example offering yoga classes and helping lead virtual college tours. Local partners can also be leveraged to support telehealth programs. Anthem Blue Cross, a managed care plan serving approximately 1.3 million members across 29 counties in California and framed as a “digital-first” company, is committed to expanding access to care and improving the health status of children and families. Together with other managed care organizations, Anthem formed a multi-payer collaborative approach to offer safety net clinics in the Central Valley no-cost access to e-consults to expand access to specialty care. These plans make e-consults accessible to federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), rural health centers, and Indian Health Centers at no cost. This includes the UCSF Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Portal through which SBHC/WC and other providers can request psychiatry consultations and which includes free one-time virtual visits for SBHC/WCs operated by FQHCs. To expand the use and availability of telehealth with SBHC/WCs, Anthem is also offering to safety net clinics and SBHC/WCs a no-cost Virtual Case Kiosk Program, which includes a digital kiosk that comes on a rolling cart or stand with multiple video conference applications pre-configured on the iPad. The digital kiosk can be ideal for SBHC/WCs without a telehealth solution or can be used to expand telehealth services to other local schools. The Virtual Care Kiosk program works with multiple video conference apps and includes on-demand interpreter services with over 200 languages, very minimal lag time, no cost for Anthem patients, and discounted costs for others. <h3>Schools without SBHC/WCs</h3> Schools and school districts that do not have the benefit of SBHC/WCs and want to offer telehealth services to students can select among established telehealth providers, partner with community-based health care providers, or create their own program. There are a number of existing agencies that provide telehealth primary care services or other telehealth services. Hazel Health specifically focuses on providing this care in school settings. One school district in Southern California contracts with Hazel Health to deliver physical health services via telehealth for students as part of its solution to address student health and wellness. Hazel Health provided the district with equipment such as a locked medication cart and iPad rolling cart and a series of trainings for health aides and school nurses to establish a protocol and workflow. They targeted students who experienced chronic absenteeism and students who needed additional care or coverage. The cost to the district is based on the total number of enrolled students and the district used its Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) and Learning Communities for Student Success (LCSSP) grant funding to support its subscription. Utilization of this program has been lower than anticipated underscoring the importance/challenge of establishing trust and confidence with a purely telehealth provider. These arrangements are relatively simple for school districts because of their “plug-and-play” nature but may require the school district to cover the full costs of the program, as opposed to generating reimbursement through Medi-Cal or other sources. Schools can work with local providers and partners to create their own telehealth programs. Because of the COVID pandemic, many more community-based health providers (i.e. community health centers, mental health agencies) have new capacity and expertise in delivering telehealth services. Partnering with these organizations to create telehealth arrangements can be a fruitful strategy for school districts without SBHC/WCs. These arrangements are relatively simple for school districts because of their “plug-and-play” nature but can cost districts significantly more than a similar community-based service because they are unable to recoup many costs through Medi-Cal, CHIP, or other insurance reimbursement. They also lack natural connections to the local health care safety net and do not typically provide well care or sexual and reproductive health services. This is a good option for school districts with a low concentration of students who are eligible for free or reduced price meals and for primary school grades. The dedicated help for start-up is positive but may leave school districts with a large price tag. Schools can work with local providers and partners to create their own telehealth program but this can be complicated and time-consuming. It is best achieved through close partnerships with local health care providers that know the requirements, limitations, legal, and financial terrain. If a school does not have an SBHC/WC and is interested in starting a telehealth program, we recommend they reach out to their local community health center. CSHA is available to help schools identify and connect them to potential community-based partners. CSHA encourages all schools – especially schools with more than 500 students and a high concentration of those eligible for free and reduced price meals to consider starting an SBHC/WC on their campus. SBHC/WCs take advantage of in-person relationships to establish trust in a way that not only addresses the health care needs but helps connect students more firmly to school. SBHC/WCs can also help schools create a positive caring school climate. The schools most likely to find value and have the capacity to house brick-and-mortar SBHC/WCs are large schools with a high proportion of students who are eligible for free and reduced price meals (i.e., Title I schools), since SBHC/WCs are able to generate reimbursement from services delivered to students enrolled in the Medi-Cal program.

These services may include sexual health education, contraception, pregnancy and STI testing, counseling, and referrals to services. Research has shown that SBHCs effectively address reproductive and sexual health needs. <h2>Sexual Health Education: California Healthy Youth Act</h2> The California Healthy Youth Act (AB 329) went into effect in January 2016 and requires schools to provide all students in grades 7-12 with age-appropriate sexual health education that is comprehensive and medically accurate. The law mandates that curriculum must be LGBTQ+ inclusive so that no students are left out, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation. It also requires schools to provide information on sexually transmitted infections/HIV prevention, pregnancy prevention, consent, and healthy relationships (how to avoid adolescent relationship abuse and sex trafficking). <h2>SBHCs Prevent & Address Teen Dating Violence</h2> Healthy relationships, particularly in the context of dating or sexual activity, play an important role in increasing the use of contraception and preventing teen pregnancy. Being located in schools, school-based health centers (SBHCs) are in close proximity to teens’ social environment and have a unique ability to assess adolescents for dating violence and reproductive coercion. SBHCs can also provide counseling support or referrals to address these issues, in addition to promoting respectful relationships through both clinical and classroom education.  Adolescent relationship abuse is common among adolescent seeking services, with one study reporting a 40% lifetime prevalence of physical/sexual violence victimization among adolescent females who use urban teen clinics. 7 In a Teen Dating Violence pilot study with two adolescent health centers (one of which was an SBHC), researchers found that clients welcomed providers discussing healthy relationships with them, and they saw significant increases in youth knowledge of Teen Dating Violence resources, and reductions in tech abuse. 8 Here are some suggestions of practices for SBHCs to consider adopting: Sample screening questions to ask all adolescents: <h3>Resources</h3> <h4>Reproductive Health Policy Statement</h4> This policy statement outlines the benefits of offering comprehensive reproductive health education and services at SBHCs. The statement provides a rationale for, and offers recommendations on the delivery of, such services and can be a useful advocacy tool. <h4>Attracting & Retaining Adolescent Patients</h4> This toolkit can assist SBHCs that serve the entire community in maintaining an adolescent-friendly practice to ensure the best healthcare experience for a young person. The resource walks through each step of an average appointment—from the front desk, to the waiting room, to the medical visit—and provides strategies for creating an adolescent-friendly practice with visibility throughout the school. In addition, it presents policy advocacy opportunities for those interested in advancing adolescent-friendly health services. <h4>Teen Pregnancy Prevention at School-Based Health Centers: Challenges & Opportunities</h4> School-based health centers (SBHCs) have played a strong role in California’s efforts to prevent teen pregnancy.

Untreated vision problems adversely impact student learning. This occurs through both direct and indirect mechanisms, including by compromising sensory perception, hampering cognition and negatively affecting social-emotional development and connectedness to school. 2 According to the American Optometric Association, “symptoms of visual problems that threaten educational achievement include frequent eye rubbing or blinking, short attention span, avoidance of reading and other close activities, frequent headaches, covering of one eye, tilting the head to one side, holding reading materials close to the face, eyes turning in or out, seeing double, losing place when reading, and difficulty remembering what has been read.” 3 <h2>School-Based Services Can Help Correct Vision Problems</h2> Schools are natural locations for the provision of vision services. School-based screening programs, coupled with referrals and follow-up, can increase treatment rates. In addition, there is growing evidence of the effectiveness of providing providing professional optometric services on school campuses. 4 <h2>Resources</h2> <h5>A Guide for Vision Testing in California Public Schools</h5> This guide, from the California Department of Education, provides district and school health personnel with a single document that contains guidelines for a vision testing program and the laws and regulations that govern it. The guidelines will facilitate the planning and implementation of programs for assessment of vision so that all students in California public schools may benefit from optimal use of their sense of sight throughout their school years. <h5>Vision to Learn</h5> Vision to Learn provides vision screenings, eye exams, and glasses to children in low-income communities, at no cost to the children or their families.

When identifying substance use for Native American youth it is important to remember: <h1>SUD Risk & Protective Factors</h1> It is important to identify both risk and protective factors because they represent opportunities for early intervention among Native American youth at greatest risk for adverse outcomes. Protective factors are conditions that protect against the incident of an adverse outcome (e.g., substance use) or promote the occurrence of a desirable outcome within a young person’s environment. Risk factors can be predictors of maladaptive behaviors or adverse conditions that exist at the structural, community, family, interpersonal, or individual levels. The existence of risk factors can increase the likelihood that an individual will acquire struggles with substance use compared to someone else without risk factors. Among Native American youth, historical trauma is a significant risk factor that pervades all levels of influence. Starting in the mid-1990s, the construct of historical trauma was presented into the behavioral health field to contextualize and explain elevated rates of psychological/social suffering and health inequalities among Native American populations. Native American historical trauma is distinguished by its emphasis on ancestral hardship that is intergenerationally transmitted in ways that negatively impact descendent well-being. Research shows some of the most significant social and intergenerational risk factors making Native American youth more vulnerable to SUDs are as follows: As a response to the impact of historical trauma and elevated mental health distress, Native American communities throughout California have developed a robust Native American behavioral health field including research on SUD protective factors. As part of the Native American driven behavioral health movement, Native researchers and practitioners stress the importance of taking a social-ecological perspective to promoting wellness and health for Native American youth. Below are important research informed protective factors for Native American youth from a social-ecological perspective (Nebelkopf & Penagos, 2005; Henson et al., 2017): <h1>Treatment Strategies: Tribal Best Practices</h1> In many Native American communities evidence-based substance use practices have been unsuccessful. A growing movement for substance use in Native American communities is termed Tribal Best Practices. These grassroot programs are common throughout Native American communities and often blend western science and theories with traditional knowledge and local Native American cultural values. Examples of Tribal Best Practices to reduce youth substance use include: Often, it is important for schools and SUD programs to work with local Native American community mental health workers. They often hold local understandings of history, culture, and traditional views of health and wellness and may reduce barriers to care while promoting tribal health, self-determination, and sovereignty. To see organizations who are doing Native American youth SUD work utilizing Native American community mental health workers, please see the Native American Technical Assistance Provider project . It is important to tailor substance use assessments and treatment strategies to Native American youth. We hope that this reference guide will help you think about possible next steps of how to implement some of these practices in your SBHC. We encourage you to partner with a local Native American organization so they can help you determine what might work best for the Native American youth in your area. <h2>Download a Printable Guide</h2> 1.

{"page_id": 2983, "title": "SBIRT Quick Guide: Referral to Treatment", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/sbirt-quick-guides/referral/", "content": "<h2>Why Adopt Referral to Treatment for Substance Use?</h2> Referral to treatment is intended for youth who have a substance use disorder (SUD) and therefore need specialty SUD treatment that is typically beyond the scope of primary care settings such as SBHCs. <h1>What are the different types of SUD treatment?</h1> There are many different types of treatment for youth with SUDs. The treatment types can fall into these general categories: <h4>Behavioral approaches</h4> Psychosocial approaches address the underlying causes and impacts of SUD, ranging from individual counseling to group therapy. One common approach to OUD and other SUDs is Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Short-term behavioral treatment is sometimes provided by trained and qualified behavioral health providers at SBHCs. <h4>Family-based approaches</h4> When possible, including a young person’s family in treatment is highly recommended. One evidence-based approach is Brief Strategic Family Therapy. Family treatment can also sometimes be provided by a behavioral health provider at the SBHC. <h4>Medication-assisted treatment (MAT)</h4> These are medications that are effective in helping treat people with SUDs. There are medications for OUD as well as alcohol and nicotine use disorders. MAT uses FDA-approved medications that treat withdrawal symptoms and physiologic cravings. Stabilizing patients with OUD medically first often helps them recover and engage in ongoing treatment. Research has shown medications used in MAT do not adversely impact physical or mental functioning. 4 Medical professionals recommend MAT for adolescents 16 and older. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other trusted professionals recommend that adolescents with OUD be offered pharmacotherapy with buprenorphine, naltrexone, or methadone. No age-specific safety concerns have been identified, and MAT is consistent with a harm reduction approach that most adolescent providers embrace in other aspects of care. SBHC providers should know about therapies such as buprenorphine and be able to make a productive referral to someone who offers MAT when indicated. Some adolescent providers should even consider prescribing MAT to their youth patients when indicated. We know that MAT works. Decades of studies of MAT and adults with OUD unequivocally show that MAT contributes to significant reductions in opioid use, criminal activity, overdose, and other risky behaviors in adults. It reduces morbidity and mortality by two thirds, reduces progression to intravenous drug use and therefore decreases the risk of HIV and hepatitis C transmission. MAT has been shown to reduce drug dependence and decrease the risk of overdose and relapse by as much as half. 5 MAT studies with youth are more limited. There have been few randomized clinical trials, but they have demonstrated that timely receipt of buprenorphine, naltrexone, or methadone is associated with greater retention in care among youth with OUD compared with behavioral treatment only. 6 Opioids disrupt the brain’s reward-learning pathways. Over time the body adapts and exposure to the drug is necessary to maintain baseline. Buprenorphine is a partial opioid receptor agonist, activating opioid receptors in the brain and at low doses blocking pain receptors, preventing painful opioid withdrawal symptoms but not causing euphoria like full opioid agonists (e.g., heroin, morphine, Vicodin, or OxyContin). Partial agonists ameliorate the highs and lows associated with full agonists. They also have a “ceiling,” so using more of them is not very different than using a prescribed dose. Buprenorphine binds opioid receptors tightly and blocks the effects of full agonists as well as helping prevent overdose if a person goes back to using. Buprenorphine is often combined with naloxone which prevents it from being abused or diverted. This makes it less likely to cause respiratory distress or death. <h4>Buprenorphine</h4> <h4>Methadone</h4> The best medication to use depends on patient needs, and individual treatment planning should dictate the particular course of action. Although studies have shown that MAT can be effective alone, optimally MAT should be combined with psychosocial interventions such as CBT, peer support, and other social and behavioral support services specific to youth and addressing unique risk factors. These services can help improve emotional regulation and support young people in developing more adaptive stress responses. <h3>What are best practices when implementing referral to treatment?</h3> If a young person is an emancipated minor or is an adult age 18 or older, they can consent to replacement narcotic abuse treatment for themselves under California law. Otherwise, minors (youth under age 18) typically need parent or guardian consent to receive replacement narcotic abuse treatment. Frequently Asked Questions about Minor Consent for Substance Use Disorder Services in California has information on Family Code 6929. You can find more information about consent laws here . Best practices suggest that family involvement is helpful to ensure support for young people and to address the underlying factors that can maintain addiction. Evidence points to the effectiveness of family-based interventions in preventing and treating substance use in youth, and some recent research suggests that health settings are a good place to engage parents. Minors 12 and older can consent to many SUD services on their own and obtain those services confidentially; however, most minors cannot obtain replacement narcotic abuse treatment without parent or guardian involvement. If a young person does not want to be referred to replacement narcotic abuse treatment because they do not want their parent or guardian to know, then the provider should respect that decision. However, it is important to share the benefits of parent/guardian involvement with the young person. For example, a provider could explain to a young person that MAT can be a long process, and it is important that the family knows so they can help provide support. Regardless, it may be a good idea for the provider to offer counseling as a first step. Referrals to SUD treatment, in conjunction with brief interventions, should begin at age 12. Youth should receive referrals to treatment whenever they have a SUD, need specialty treatment beyond the scope of the SBHC, and have the appropriate consents. The sooner a provider links a young person to treatment, the more likely they are to show up to their appointment, stick with treatment, and experience good outcomes. 7 The provider (medical or behavioral health) should conduct the referral to treatment with the young person while they are in a private room. If possible, the provider should call the referral while the young person is in the room and their parent/guardian is on the line. The provider should record the referral to treatment in their chart notes. A follow up appointment should be scheduled so the SBHC provider can check in with the young person and ensure they are receiving the care they need. Treatment often takes many attempts, so providers with trusted relationships should try to maintain continuity and inquire non-judgmentally whether their patient is continuing treatment. In the case of treatment lapses, providers can use motivational interviewing to help re-engage youth and also consider whether different referrals are needed. For more information on motivational interviewing, please refer to the CSHA brief intervention quick guide . Treatment should be voluntary and the patient must be motivated. Youth may be reluctant to try something new and give up something they perceive to be working for them as a coping mechanism. They may not be ready for treatment, especially if they have not suffered from significant personal consequences because of their use. If the youth is not ready, there is the opportunity to provide brief intervention as an alternative. Please refer to the CSHA brief intervention quick guide . Young people should expect to be on MAT for a long period of time. MAT can last at least 8-12 weeks before gradual tapering can be introduced. Longer treatment with MAT produces better outcomes, and tapering too quickly off any opioid can have unfortunate or even tragic consequences. The best treatment for youth with OUD addresses both biology and experience. This helps young people improve function in their prefrontal cortex; decrease the reward pathway carved out by opioid addiction; reduce stress and cravings; and regulate emotions. Providers should consider referrals to both a behavioral health provider and a medical provider who has the ability to provide MAT. <h4>What should I do now?</h4> <h2>About Naloxone</h2> Naloxone is a life-saving medication that reverses an opioid overdose with little risk.

{"page_id": 2963, "title": "SBIRT Quick Guide: Screening for Substance Use", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/sbirt-quick-guides/screening/", "content": "<h2>Why Screen for Substance Use?</h2> Because of their early initiation, youth who use substances are at increased risk for health, educational, and social challenges related to alcohol and drugs. SBHCs are ideal places to identify these youth and provide evidence-based services that inform them about the health risks associated with alcohol and drug use, motivate them to change their behaviors, and support them in addressing the concerns that may be underlying their substance use. Using brief, structured, and scientifically validated screening protocols can improve service providers’ capacity to identify youth who are using alcohol or drugs. 4 Screening is important since youth may continue to do well in school and in other areas of life despite severe SUD. 5 Screening tools are not intended to diagnose if youth have a SUD or determine the severity of a youth’s substance use. Rather, they can quickly indicate if youth are using alcohol and/ or drugs, and alert providers that they need to have a more detailed conversation with the young person to get more information about their use. <h2>What is the best way to screen?</h2> The most practical way to screen for substance use is through the use of questionnaires or clinical interviews. Research shows that youth are willing to self-disclose when asked about alcohol and drug use. 6 Two screening tools specifically designed for youth are the CRAFFT and S2BI. These screeners are highly recommended because they: <h3>What are best practices when implementing screening?</h3> Screenings should begin at age 12. Ideally, all youth would receive regular screenings for substance use, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all youth should receive screening at every medical visit (no more than monthly). Some screening tools were created to be administered at every visit (e.g., the CRAFFT) and some were created to be administered annually (e.g., the S2BI). The CRAFFT and S2BI can be self-administered by youth, either on paper or electronically on computers, tablets, or phones. Having youth complete screening tools themselves instead of conducting face-to-face interviews for screening has several advantages: youth prefer self-administered tools, they are more likely to disclose sensitive information, and it can save staff time. 4 Digital screening is preferable but paper is also effective. Screening tools can also be included with other intake forms. Screening should be administered in a confidential space. Front desk staff can administer it while the young person is waiting for their appointment, medical assistants can administer it in the exam room before the provider arrives, or a behavioral health provider or health educator can administer it in their office. Wherever the screening takes place, try to ensure the space allows for confidentiality. The front desk staff, medical assistant, health educator, or provider can record and calculate the screening results in the patient’s chart. Staff time and confidential space are important considerations for determining who will take the lead on calculating and recording the results. The provider (medical, behavioral health, or health education) should interpret the screening results and share the results with the young person while they are in a private room. How the provider shares the screening results depends on the outcome: For negative screens (for example, a CRAFFT score of 1), the provider should deliver positive affirmations that encourage youth who are not using substances, as encouragement can help reinforce positive choices that youth make. For example 7 : For positive screens (for example, a CRAFFT score of 2 or higher), the provider should move to the second part of SBIRT: brief intervention . <h4>What should I do now?</h4> <h2>Download a Printable Guide</h2> Facilitating Change for Excellence in SBIRT – Guidance on using SBIRT from the National Council for Behavioral Health, Improving Adolescent Health CRAFFT Screening Tool – Guidance on using the CRAFFT Screening Tool from Boston University Center for Adolescent Substance Abuse Research Adolescent SBIRT Toolkit for Providers – Guidance on using the S2BI screening tool from the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Project Adolescent Substance Use Screening Overview – Resources on screening for adolescent substance use from the Conrad N.

{"page_id": 2957, "title": "SBIRT Quick Guide: Brief Interventions", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/sbirt-quick-guides/brief-interventions/", "content": "<h2>Why Adopt Brief Interventions for Substance Use?</h2> Brief interventions are structured conversations designed to address alcohol and/or drug use among youth who are using substances, but do not need specialty SUD treatment. They are intended to be used when a young person screens positive for substance use or the need to discuss substance use emerges some other way. The goal of brief interventions is to have a discussion aimed at reinforcing a youth’s self-determination to reduce their risky behavior. Brief interventions are designed to be delivered in non-SUD treatment settings such as SBHCs. <h2>Motivational interviewing: The best way to conduct brief interventions</h2> Motivational interviewing is a collaborative, client-centered counseling style that guides individuals to elicit and strengthen their motivation for change. 4 Rather than advising youth that they “should” or “need to” stop using alcohol or drugs, providers use motivational interviewing to have open conversations, using reflective listening skills and other conversational techniques to mobilize a young person’s own intrinsic values as motivation to change their substance use. Research shows that motivational interviewing is the most effective tool for achieving meaningful and lasting changes in substance use behavior within a relatively brief time period. 5-6 Using motivational interviewing, providers can help youth identify their own reasons to either reduce substance use or stop altogether, and collaboratively develop strategies to achieve behavior change goals. <h3>What are some techniques for brief interventions?</h3> The Brief Negotiated Interview (BNI) is a semi structured interview process based on motivational interviewing and can be completed in 5-15 minutes. “What’s a typical day like for you? What do you like to do? How does Vicodin fit in?” “What do you like less about Vicodin? Do you ever regret using Vicodin?” If they can’t think of any cons, explore problems mentioned on the CRAFFT, i.e.: “You said that you have gotten into trouble while using Vicodin. Tell me more about that.” “So on one hand you enjoy Vicodin because….and on the other hand it has caused these problems…” “We know that use of opioids by young people has some negative consequences. They can lead to short-term problems like impaired ability to learn, family relationship issues, and overdose & death, along with long-term consequences like collapsed veins, respiratory problems, and liver disease.” “Young people who use prescription opioids in their early teens are more likely to be using heroin when they graduate from high school. Because your brain is still developing, opioids can cause permanent changes in your brain and make you more vulnerable to addiction as an adult.” “What do you think about this information?” Use to determine how ready the young person is to make a change, how important making a change is to them, or how confident they are that they will be able to make the change “Why did you choose that number and not a lower number, like a 1 or a 2?” “That’s great, it means you’re ___% ready to make a change.” Reflect their response and say: “So it sounds like you have some reasons to make a change.” “What do you want your life to look like down the road?” (Probe for goals) “How does this change fit in with those goals?” “What might be some challenges in accomplishing your goal with regard to Vicodin?” “What’s something you have accomplished in the past that you felt proud of? Who or what helped you succeed in that How can you use that (person or method) to help you with the challenges of making this change now?” “If you make this change, how would things be better for you?” (If available, present list of local resources) “Which of these services, if any, are you interested in to help you with your goal?” “OK, here’s the action plan we’ve discussed. This is really an agreement between you and yourself.” “Thanks so much for coming in and talking with me today! I’d love to see you come back in X weeks.” FLO stands for Feedback, Listen & Understand, and Options Explored. It takes 15 minutes and condenses the main elements of brief interventions into three steps. The provider is listening for their reasons for using substances (trying to understand them), and their reasons for reducing or stopping. “What would be some of the good things about cutting down or stopping your use of Vicodin?” is a question that directly “pulls” for change talk. The provider can offer options if the youth has difficulty coming up with their own ideas. Try to provide concrete examples of things they can do to reduce their risk of harm, e.g., not drinking or cutting back on the number of drinks per day. Remember that youth have a choice. Doing nothing is also an option. The provider can also offer to check in frequently. Very often, attention paid to one’s behavior can be an intervention. <h3>What are best practices when implementing brief interventions?</h3> Frequently Asked Questions about Minor Consent for Substance Use Disorder Services in California has information on Family Code 6929. Brief interventions, in conjunction with screening, should begin at age 12. Youth should receive brief interventions whenever they screen positive for a substance use screening. The provider (medical, behavioral health, or health education) should conduct the brief intervention with the young person while they are in a private room. The provider should also summarize the brief intervention in their chart notes.

Much of this rise can be attributed to the deceptive marketing tactics employed by the tobacco industry, leading many youths to perceive vaping as a means of stress relief. According to data from the Truth Initiative, a majority of youth who have used e-cigarettes started vaping to decrease their feelings of stress, anxiety or depression, and 50% of youth report they continue to vape to deal with stress or anxiety. While youth may turn to vaping to deal with their increasing stress, the evidence shows that vaping can have the opposite effect, actually worsening mental health symptoms, and creating a cycle of addiction that has negative consequences on the physical and mental health of youth. Many young people are unaware that vaping as a coping strategy may actually make them feel worse.  School health staff have a critical role in increasing awareness of the connections between youth vaping and mental well-being. <h2>The Nicotine Addiction Cycle</h2> An understanding of the nicotine addiction cycle can help to contextualize how vaping and other uses of nicotine intersects with mental health. The cycle starts once a young person uses a vape. This initial experience often includes moments of euphoria and improved mood, which can be intensely pleasurable. However, this pleasure is short-lived. As it dissipates, youth may repeatedly vape to try and recreate that pleasurable sensation. This repeated usage can quickly lead to the development of a high tolerance, ultimately resulting in nicotine dependence. This dependence manifests through withdrawal symptoms, which may trigger feelings of anxiety, irritability, and a focus on when they can vape next to recapture that sense of well-being. This cycle of craving perpetuates itself, creating a continuous loop. <h2>Nicotine Impact on the Brain</h2> Nicotine constricts blood vessels and increases heart rate. Research suggests that nicotine may trigger cortisol production which causes us to falsely believe that nicotine helps us manage stress more effectively. However, by regularly consuming a substance that replicates a stress response in our bodies when performing everyday tasks, we risk overexposing our bodies to cortisol and other stress hormones that disrupt the body’s processes and put us at risk for poor mental health. Nicotine also increases nicotinic receptors over time , which provides that stressful feeling every time those receptors aren’t getting nicotine. <h2>How School-Based Health Centers & Wellness Centers Can Support Youth with Addiction</h2> It’s important to remember that supporting youth with addiction is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a collaborative approach involving schools, school health partners, parents/guardians, and community resources. <h2>Therapeutic Interventions</h2>", "modified": "2025-10-01T16:34:35", "slug": "vaping", "status": "publish", "excerpt": "The Detrimental Intersection of Vaping & Youth Mental Health Over the past decade, there has been a notable surge in the number of young people turning to vaping products that contain nicotine, a trend exacerbated by the ongoing youth mental health crisis.

Peer education programs have demonstrated effectiveness in preventing youth tobacco use. 1 Cannabis: A plant containing two main chemicals – THC and CBD – that cause direct effects on the body. Cannabis also refers to products derived from the plant Cannabis Sativa THC: Short for Tetrahyrodcannabinol, the ingredient that gives cannabis its addictive psychoactive property, meaning it will make the user feel “high” CBD: Short for Cannabidoil, CBD is a non-psychoactive compound found in cannabis plants. Unlike THC, it does not produce a “high” Other terms: There are well over 1000 names and slang terms for cannabis, including marijuana, bud, 420, pot, weed, mota, ganga, for example. Some of these terms carry cultural meaning and stigma, so we recommend using the term cannabis to remain as non-judgmental and factual as possible. <h3>The Role of SBHCs in Cannabis Use Education & Prevention</h3> SBHCs/WCs are well positioned to help students with cannabis use through prevention, health education, harm reduction, and cessation services. <h3>Youth-Friendly Approaches to Providing Effective Cannabis Education & Prevention Programs</h3> Ultimately, tackling cannabis and other substance use among youth requires a multifaceted approach that prioritizes prevention, education, and support. By promoting youth-friendly approaches and coping strategies, SBHCs can empower young individuals to make healthier choices and thrive despite the challenges they may face. The Stanford Tobacco Prevention Toolkit offers theory-based and evidence-informed resources created by educators, parents, and researchers aimed at preventing middle and high school students’ use of tobacco and nicotine. Stanford REACH Lab has additional resources, including Safety First , the Cannabis Prevention Toolkit , the Vaping Information, Solutions, and Interventions Toolkit (VISIT) , and the Healthy Futures Curriculum , which is an alternative to suspensions education program for students caught using tobacco substances on campus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has useful information on current tobacco use among youth, factors associated with use, and recommendations on how to reduce use at the national, state, and local levels. <h4>Resources for Parents</h4> The American Lung Association provides tips for talking to kids about smoking along with resources for parents who want to quit smoking. There are many resources out there for young people to learn more about the effects of tobacco and nicotine, but it can be overwhelming to read so much information. In hope of easing the burden and engaging more young people, CSHA put together some of the most youth-friendly tobacco education resources.

The Triangulum refers to the interconnected relationship between tobacco, cannabis, and vaping/e-cigarettes. With the rapid rise of vapes and other delivery systems for tobacco and cannabis use, the landscape of “smoking” has changed significantly. Today, tobacco, cannabis and vaping are often related and used together. For example, a person might smoke a joint that contains both cannabis and tobacco, or use a vape that contains cannabis abstracts. It is common for youth to use both tobacco and cannabis, either at the same time, one after the other, or in combination with other substances, especially since vaping devices for both tobacco and cannabis are widely available and can often be used for multiple substances. In California, more young people now use e-cigarettes than traditional cigarettes, and cannabis use is higher than all tobacco use combined. 1 There is a strong link between using tobacco and cannabis. Additionally, the tobacco and cannabis products themselves and delivery systems, including vapes, edibles, combustible wraps, tinctures, are constantly changing, making it difficult for the consumer to understand the potency and risks associated with use. Historically, resources and support for tobacco use and cannabis use have been separate, largely due to distinct funding sources. However, understanding how tobacco, cannabis and vaping are linked is essential, and helps us find better ways to prevent and reduce their use, especially among young people. The Triangulum framework compels us to reduce the silos around different substances, and offer comprehensive drug education, prevention, and intervention that recognizes the intersections and complexity. <h2>Resources</h2> These resources can be used with elementary, middle, and/or high school students.

In California, we have minor consent laws which enable young people aged 12 and over to consent to some services. Minor consent laws allow young people aged 12 and over to consent to certain services without parent or guardian involvement. Minors may consent to certain services related to sexual and reproductive health, mental health, and drug and alcohol treatment.   When a young person accesses services under minor consent laws, those services are to be maintained confidentially – meaning that providers are bound by law to not share this information, including with parents/guardians. In order to receive services, not only does a person need to consent to them, but they also need to be able to access them.  School-based health centers and wellness centers (SBHC/WCs) increase access to services by offering them in a place that is familiar, trusted, and convenient – in school. SBHC/WCs play a unique role for young people consenting to services under minor consent laws.  Not only do SBHC/WCs increase access to minor consent services but also they enable young people to access these services in a truly confidential manner.  Young people who need minor consent services do not have to worry about transportation to and from their appointment and can have their absence from class excused.  SBHC/WCs help enable young people to consent and access services that they are entitled to by California law. <h2>Minor Consent Laws</h2> <h4>Minor Consent Mental Health Rights in California (AB 665)</h4> Assembly Bill 665, signed by the Governor in October 2023, created a new minor consent mental health right in California.  This bill aligns the existing laws by authorizing a minor who is 12 years of age or older to consent to mental health treatment or counseling on an outpatient basis if the minor is mature enough to participate.  This bill also aligns the existing laws by requiring the professional person treating or counseling the minor to consult with the minor before determining whether involvement of the minor’s parent or guardian would be inappropriate. <h4>Minor Consent Medical Rights in California (AB 816)</h4> Assembly Bill 816, signed by the Governor in October 2023, created a new minor consent medical right in California.  This bill authorizes a minor who is 16 years of age or older to consent to replacement narcotic abuse treatment that uses buprenorphine at a physician’s office, clinic, or health facility, by a licensed physician and surgeon or other health care provider, whether or not the minor also has the consent of their parent or guardian. <h4>Minor Consent Reproductive Health Rights in California (AB 499)</h4> Assembly Bill 499, signed by the Governor in October 2011, created a new minor consent health right in California. Previously, the law allowed minors to consent to diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, but did not allow them to consent to services that would prevent sexually transmitted diseases. Under AB 499, adolescents aged 12 and over can give their own consent for services that prevent sexually transmitted diseases, including the HPV vaccine, the Hep B vaccine, and post-exposure HIV prophylaxis.

After time-limited grants help build out a system, what resources are available to sustain the services and initiative? Schools and community providers do not have the resources to sustain school mental health services on their own. No single entity (school, or community, or county) can provide the whole range of comprehensive services, for all students. Trust, partnerships, coordination, and community buy-in will help entities bring together resources to build out a comprehensive system of services. Also, there is not a national or state model for how to fund these services. While available funding is largely federal and state, many decisions about how to use funding and what services to prioritize happen at the local level. So, there may be examples of how different counties and school districts across California sustain mental health services, however there is not one “best” way to sustain these services. The resources in this section will help you (1) learn about the funding streams that are available to sustain school mental health services .

In order for efforts to be most effective, there needs to be collaboration and buy-in at every level of leadership. The leadership between education and mental health entities need to coordinate efforts and work together from the State leadership, to the county and district leadership, to the school site and local mental health providers. This coordination is challenging work for many reasons as leadership, staff, and providers can often have different points of view, different priorities and even use different language. This makes commitment to working together and across the systems so important and requires patience, flexibility and creativity. In efforts to support student mental health, collaboration between student supports, including partner agencies, and school administration and staff is vital. Included in this section are resources to support efforts of coordination at different levels of leadership. There are multiple “layers” of coordination to consider: at the school site level responding directly to student needs to regional or county levels where systemic issues and collective responses can be addressed and discussed. Building a team to coordinate supports and referrals is a significant component of successful school mental health partnerships. Coordination teams come in many different shapes, sizes, and names. One approach for coordinating and working together is through a site-based Coordination of Services Team (COST) (see guide and resources included below). Regardless of what the coordination process is called, there are several important components: Based on your needs assessment, an overall understanding of the entire continuum of services available in the system of care. It is important that various coordination teams, to the best of their ability, understand who provides what services in the system of care, how students are referred to services, and eligibility determinations. A universal referral form that allows students, parents, and all staff to refer students when there is indication support could be beneficial. Examples of COST referral forms are also included. The referral form ensures that students have access to available services. Regular meetings among support staff and school staff to discuss student referrals and create plans of support at the school site level. Regular meetings ensure that staff have the opportunity to share data (while ensuring confidentiality) and report back on student outcomes, reflect on trends and needs that are coming up across the school and ways to increase school wide efforts. For example, a high number of referrals for freshman girls experiencing anxiety during the first six months of school could lead to creating support groups and curriculum implemented across a class that all freshmen are taking. Screening students school-wide for mental health risks enables students to access early intervention and allows schools to notice trends and create supports tailored to their communities. Coordination between mental health agencies and the school personnel is required for quality and effective screening and planning for meeting students’ needs. See more information about School-wide screening protocols, as well as specific considerations about screening for trauma in the resources below. Tracking student data and outcomes of referrals and services ensures that the needs of the students are being met as well as identifying early warning indicators that will help provide early intervention for often overlooked students. Some school sites have been able to implement the COST referral form and services to students’ educational accounts through the school so that teachers and all staff can access real time updates on what is working to help the student. One of the biggest challenges in coordinating student mental health programs and services arises around issues of confidentiality, protected health and student information, and data sharing ; simply put, there are federal and state laws that protect student and patient information. We have included a comprehensive guide to help partners understand these laws and identify practices to facilitate coordination and protect student information. <h3>Resources</h3> For County, Regional & District Efforts For District & Local School Site & Mental Health Agency Efforts Sample COST Forms Screening Student Mental Health Guides Confidentiality & Data Sharing", "modified": "2025-08-29T20:53:41", "slug": "section-6-coordination", "status": "publish", "excerpt": "Collaboration and coordination among community partners in the education and mental health field are necessary to increase student mental health.

Some considerations when starting the assessment process: The Student Behavioral Health Incentive Program is a state-wide project with the goal of improving coordination of child and adolescent behavioral health services for those enrolled in Medi-Cal through increased communication with schools, school-affiliated programs, managed care providers, counties and mental health providers. A key element of the program includes 58 needs assessments that can serve as a source of youth behavioral health data in each county. Components of the needs assessment include community partner meetings to gain diverse perspectives, data collection strategies engaging various groups, and an assessment template detailing specific actions per LEA. The assessment uncovers prevalent behavioral health needs, proposes short/long-term actions, and identifies service delivery gaps, population-specific disparities, and referral process barriers. It maps existing resources, budgets, program enhancements, and strategies for promoting services to students, staff, and parents. Lastly, it outlines the closed-loop referral process for internal and external behavioral health referrals within each LEA, emphasizing coordination and monitoring of student support services. <h4>According to the Youth Engagement researchers at the Search Institute:</h4> In order for youth involvement to be successful, it should engage them in meaningful decision-making.

{"page_id": 5001, "title": "Section 10: Evaluation", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/student-mental-health-implementation-guide/section-10-evaluation/", "content": "Evaluation is important for quality improvement and sustainability in order to understand whether mental health services are designed to be suitable, accessible, and acceptable by the patient population and to ensure that such services remain viable. Program evaluation will also help quantify the extent to which goals and objectives are being met and measure the impact of services on outcomes. When providing health and mental health services, it is important to bring a framework of Quality Assurance and Continuous Quality Improvement. Quality Assurance (QA) ensures that the services are meeting the goals and standards established. Quality Improvement asks what can be done to not only meet the goals and standards but to also exceed them. Providing screening for students is a key way to conduct QA & QI. See Section 6 for a discussion of school mental health screening and a list of tools. There are many important reasons to collect data about student mental health services and student outcomes. In the current California environment, each entity involved in school mental health (e.g., teacher, school, school psychologist, specialty mental health provider) has its own regulatory and funding requirements regarding documentation, data collection and reporting, and the education and mental health sectors differ in what/how they collect this information and limited in what they can share. The purpose of this chapter is to support schools and their partners in understanding student mental health needs, how well those are being addressed at an individual and aggregate level, sharing information in ways that are legally permitted and support students, and targeting improvements in services and systems. <h3>Setting Up Systems for Data Collection</h3> School districts maintain comprehensive records of student educational data such as attendance, grades, and test scores. Some of these systems also include information about student 504 plans and IEPs; however, most do not additionally track information such as needs identified by assessments or screenings that do NOT result in Special Education enrollment. There are also limited options for recording student participation in services that would be helpful for the school team and others to understand. As California advances toward better integration of student mental health, this should change. There are likely to be a proliferation of vendors offering modules or add-ons to support this tracking and communication. School districts should be mindful of ways to make this information accessible to the right people on the team without broadcasting sensitive information. A good system should also allow tracking of outcomes over time, as with IEP supports. <h3>Sharing Information</h3> As discussed in Sections 6 and 8, there are legal safeguards in place that prevent sensitive student mental health information from being shared without a justifiable purpose and/or appropriate consents. These protections are different in the education system, governed by FERPA, than in health and mental health, as stipulated by HIPAA. This is indeed one reason it can be challenging to engage meaningful collaborations across the sectors – hence silos. However, many LEAs and their partners are finding strategies to share student mental health information, either on an individual basis as allowed within the law for care coordination, on a population basis with aggregated student information, or using technology to match student health and academic data and then de-identify the data. For individual-level data sharing, it is key to train all staff on HIPAA & FERPA. When staff understand the privacy laws, best practices and compliance procedures, and how it applies to them in their role and for their partner agencies, it helps tremendously with supporting strong partnerships. When there is not clear understanding, it can sometimes lead to perceptions that someone is purposely withholding information, or sharing without holding privacy and following their HIPAA or FERPA duties, which leads to mistrust, and ultimately impacts collaboration. Comprehensive and consistent training ensures that staff know how to navigate the complexities and that they are following responsible data sharing practices. It is also essential to have a clear MOU in simple language that helps ensure everyone has clarity and is reviewed regularly. See Section 6 for an overview and resources for Coordination of Services Teams, including how to navigate sharing student information in the context of these teams. The Los Angeles Trust for Children’s Health, a nonprofit organization that supports school-based health centers/wellness centers in the Los Angeles Unified School District, has recently created a database (the Data XChange) that allows LEA & healthcare partners to submit student level information that then links health and wellness data with achievement factors such as attendance, grades and graduation rates, and then de-identifies the data so that individual-level impact can be measured without sharing individual level data across sectors. This is the first-in-the-nation initiative that was designed to interoperate with other systems and databases and includes such metrics such as number of visits, unduplicated patients, co-morbid conditions, demographics and differences between the services received by students and community members. The database also tracks services provided as well as benchmarks on key school-based health center performance standards, including risk assessments, well-child exams, BMI screening, chlamydia tests and depression screening. Use of the database’s elements allowed for a recently published study which found that visiting an SBHC is significantly associated with improved attendance over time, with more dramatic improvements for students with a mental health diagnosis. The authors go on to state that understanding how student use of school-based health centers impacts academic performance is essential for estimating potential academic and health returns on investment for school-based health services, particularly mental health. <h3>Tracking Outcomes</h3> Schools can track the progress of students receiving mental health services using a range of systems – from traditional pen-and-paper methods, to spreadsheets to online forms or surveys to more sophisticated Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. Any partners from the healthcare field will have their own EHR system, and any services that are going to be submitted for billing, through LEA-BOP traditional Medi-Cal will need to be collected electronically. Many districts contract with EHRs or Third Party Administrators (TPAs) to support documentation and billing, such as Paradigm or Welligent. Smaller districts often use the Google suite (especially forms and sheets) to document each student’s initial assessment and progress notes, and conduct progress monitoring on the individual level. The clinical supervisor then references this data to improve quality of care during clinical supervision and providing input on treatment decisions. All SBHCs run by Federally Qualified Health Centers and many others use their electronic health records and incorporate assessment and screening tools like the PHQ9 for depression, the GAD7 for anxiety, and the Youth Outreach Questionnaire to assess clinical improvement over time. <h3>Program Evaluation</h3> Evaluations come in many forms, ranging from those run by a team of external evaluators to researchers who collect and analyze data over a period of several years to simple data collection efforts by school mental health staff and partners. The scope of a school mental health evaluation depends on the resources available, the questions you want to answer, the demands of any outside funders, and other factors and competing priorities. Because resources are limited, schools implementing school mental health programs will eventually want to know that the school mental health investment is a good value. The most important thing to remember as you develop your evaluation plan is that you need to create a plan that is realistic for your team. You don’t have to measure everything! In fact, without a sufficient budget and staff capacity you are likely to get overwhelmed if you try to document everything. Instead, it is best to check in with your team and community members and prioritize what matters most to them and make sure that staff are properly trained in order to effectively capture the data identified. In addition, these questions may help start conversations amongst you and your team: It is also essential to involve students and families in the evaluation planning process, as in all other elements of mental health planning. The following set of outcomes are important to track and would likely be valuable to all stakeholders (schools, county mental health agencies, funders, students and families): There are four main steps to developing an evaluation plan: More in-depth information on types of evaluation (process, outcome, etc.) and the importance of using logic models for evaluation can be found in the resources below. <h2>Resources</h2> <h4>Chapter 9: Evaluation and Data Collection, Vision to Reality (California School-Based Health Alliance)</h4> This resource provides an overview of evaluation for school health center services, with an emphasis on what you should consider in the early stages of planning and start-up <h4>Overview of Program Evaluation (Centers for Disease Control)</h4> An overview of public health program evaluation with a clearinghouse of resources <h4>School Health Assessment and Performance Evaluation System (National Center for School Mental Health)</h4> School mental health quality assessment and resource library, including custom reports and a library of free and low-cost screening and assessment measures <h4>School Mental Health Quality Guide: Impact (National Center for School Mental Health)</h4> National resource focusing on how to document and report on effects or changes that occur as a result of SNH programs, practices and policies <h4>Evaluation and Quality in School Health Centers (Alameda County Center for Healthy Schools and Communities)</h4> An example of one county’s evaluation efforts <h4>UCSF Project Cal-Well Mental Health Program (UCSF Institute for Health Policy Studies)</h4> This includes templates and examples of ways to report outcomes for student wellness data <h2>Survey Tools</h2> <h4>California Healthy Kids Survey</h4> This is the largest statewide student survey of resiliency, protective factors, risk behaviors, and school climate in the nation <h4>Project Cal-Well School Staff Survey</h4> These data collection instruments were created to assess the social emotional wellness and mental health needs and perceptions among students and school staff", "modified": "2025-12-23T01:11:59", "slug": "section-10-evaluation", "status": "publish", "excerpt": "Evaluation is important for quality improvement and sustainability in order to understand whether mental health services are designed to be suitable, accessible, and acceptable by the patient population and to ensure that such services remain viable.

There is growing interest in bringing peer-to-peer mental health support programs to schools, and peer programs are part of a larger shift in the approach to school mental health that centers prevention, early intervention, cultural relevance and social-emotional skill development. Peer programs can complement and strengthen traditional school mental health programs. As youth move through adolescence, they increasingly turn to their peers for support, advice, and to talk through difficult experiences. Peer-to-peer support models create supportive relationships between youth, and can be particularly helpful for youth who might be resistant to traditional behavioral health models. Peer-to-peer programs can equip youth with essential accurate information on behavioral health, communication skills to talk with and support one another, and connections to mental health resources and trusted adults. <h2>See Our Resource Hub</h2> A collection of articles, tools, resources, and perspectives that support the planning and implementation of School-Based Peer-to-Peer Programs that support the well-being of young people. <h3>Why Peer-to-Peer Mental Health Supports?</h3> <h3>Starting a Peer-to-Peer Program</h3> Peer-to-peer programs can be implemented as part of a school’s comprehensive school mental health approach to support student well-being. In considering starting a peer-to-peer program, it is essential to take the time to evaluate your particular school’s unique needs, strengths, resources, student and staff composition to develop an effective program. <h3>Questions to Explore</h3> <h2>Principles of Effective Peer to Peer Programs</h2> There are many examples of effective school-based peer-to-peer programs that equip students with skills and knowledge while giving them opportunities to provide support to their peers.  These programs shared many of the following principles in their design and implementation. <h2>Peer-to-Peer Mental Health Support Models</h2> <h3>Continuum of Peer-to-Peer Support Programs</h3> There are a number of effective models of school-based peer-to-peer support, and it is important to determine what model is the best fit for a specific school community. Some models can be initiated fairly easily with interested students and an adult advisor, requiring little to no funding. Other models require a much higher level or staff support, oversight, and incorporation into the school master calendar. Similarly, more intensive peer-to-peer models, such as peer counseling, require higher levels of training for both the peers and the adult leader. <h2>Models to Consider</h2> <h3>Peer-Designed/Led Safe Spaces</h3> Engaging students to envision and create safe wellness spaces for students on campus can be a starting place for building a peer-to-peer culture. Students can poll their peers, facilitate focus groups, and engage with adult allies to create and lead these spaces. <h3>Wellness Ambassadors</h3> An accessible entry point into peer-to-peer support is a student-led club where youth are trained in mental health literacy, stigma reduction, and community engagement. Organizations such as NAMI on Campus, Bring Change to Mind, and Sources of Strength offer resources and support to schools who want to start a club. See links to their websites below for specific information about each. <h3>Peer Health Educators</h3> Peer health education can be an effective model for disseminating health information that is important to youth  in a way that youth can best hear it – from their peers.  Peer health educators are trained to provide school-wide trainings through classroom presentations, assemblies, lunch time activities etc. on a range of health topics. Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram are often used by peer health educators to creatively reach their peers with accurate, meaningful mental health information. <h3>Wellness Peers</h3> Wellness Peers are youth recruited to participate in the design and implementation of  Wellness Centers, and serve both as support for students who use the center as well as ambassadors in the school community.  Young people are often the best ambassadors for a SBHC or Wellness Center.  They have the trust of their peers and can speak authentically about the vibe, the services, and adult staff. Wellness Peers help students who are using the Wellness Center sign-in, understand the rules, and connect them to some of the self-regulating, calming stations. <h3>Restorative Justice Peer Leaders/Culture Keepers</h3> Restorative Justice Peer Leaders are trained to support their school community by leading restorative justice circles that build, repair and restore relationships.  Culture Keepers is a model that trains peers to lead mindfulness, meditation and restorative practices and facilitate peer conflict mediations.  Both models can offer a powerful alternative to more traditional disciplinary approaches when students act out or conflict arises. <h3>Peer Counseling/Peer Mentoring</h3> Peer Counseling and Mentoring Peer models are high-intensity peer programs that train youth in very specific communication and interpersonal skills who will then use those skills in a systematic and well-thought out way to provide services to each other. Often, these programs are organized through an elective class taught by a teacher with mental health training and with access to clinical support. Peers will offer one-on-support to other students, and be held to high standards. Training includes lots of opportunities for practice and role plays, training on documentation for all peer sessions, and identification of red flags that require referral. <h3>Peer Specialists/Certified Wellness Coaches</h3> Peer Specialists are paraprofessionals or young adults who have experienced similar challenges and completed specialized training to learn how to use their experience to support other youth. Peer specialists offer a range of activities and interactions focussed on promoting connection, inspiring hope, and supporting youth to set their own goals. Wellness Coaches are a new workforce program being rolled out by the state as part of the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative (CYBHI), aimed at building a more diverse behavioral health workforce in schools. <h2>Recommendations for District Leaders</h2>", "modified": "2025-11-03T22:31:05", "slug": "peer-support", "status": "publish", "excerpt": "Students Helping Students Peer-to-peer mental health support can be an effective strategy for supporting student behavioral health.

It encompasses a holistic approach that promotes emotional well-being, psychological resilience, and the development of coping skills. By actively addressing the behavioral health needs of students, schools contribute to creating a positive and supportive learning environment. This, in turn, enhances students’ overall academic performance, social interactions, and long-term success. A focus on school behavioral health not only benefits individual students but also fosters a healthier and more inclusive school community. School behavioral health is closely aligned with ongoing school and health care initiatives across the state of California, including: While this guide curates tools for building school behavioral health services and programs, none of these efforts should happen in isolation from other school and county initiatives. Implementing school behavioral health involves addressing the school environment and policies shaping the daily experiences of staff and students. It goes beyond increasing access to specific interventions, focusing on the entire school community and climate. These initiatives aim to cultivate positive school climates and cultures through supportive student and staff relationships, complemented by more targeted services for students requiring intensive support, thus forming a comprehensive approach to enhancing student behavioral health. <h3>A Note on Language</h3> In recent years, there has been a shift from using the term “mental health” to “behavioral health” to reflect a more integrated approach that includes mental health care, substance use treatment, and the role of habits and behaviors in overall well-being. In schools, behavioral health often encompasses social-emotional learning, trauma-informed practices, and supports for student wellness. At the same time, we recognize that the term “behavioral health” can feel stigmatizing or inadequate to some, particularly in communities impacted by racism, poverty, and other systemic injustices. It can imply that challenges lie within an individual’s behavior, rather than acknowledging the root causes — such as trauma, structural inequity, and environmental stressors — that shape student health and well-being. Throughout this guide, we use the term behavioral health when appropriate, while striving to center equity and healing. Many of the linked resources use the term mental health, and we have preserved that original language. <h4>Related Resources</h4>", "modified": "2025-08-15T22:14:51", "slug": "section-1-overview-of-school-mental-health", "status": "publish", "excerpt": "School mental health involves addressing the behavioral health needs of students within an educational setting.

{"page_id": 2546, "title": "Student Health Index Calculation Methodology", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/student-health-index/methodology/", "content": "The California Student Health Index was constructed by incorporating information gleaned from the analysis of the landscape of existing indices and publicly available datasets. <h4>The Student Health Index:</h4> <h4>Calculating Need Scores for schools entails three steps:</h4> <h4>The indicators used were:</h4> <h2>Merging & Spatially Linking Datasets</h2> Data in the model comes from a variety of sources. To simplify reproducibility, all census-tract level data is sourced from the UCSF Health Atlas, an interactive population health mapping website that curates publicly available data and displays it at the census tract level in California. All school-level data comes from the California Department of Education’s (CDE) Downloadable Data Files site. Data on COVID vaccination rates is collected at the zip code level by the California Department of Health and Human Services. The CDE data is available in distinct data files that must be merged using the 14-digit school code that uniquely identifies each school within California. For example, data on suspension rates, race and ethnicity, chronic absenteeism, school location, and free and reduced-price lunch eligibility are available in separate data files. In total, this analysis required the merging of five different CDE datasets. The CDE Public Schools and Districts Data Files contain a latitude and longitude for each school location, which were spatially joined with the data from their underlying census tracts using Stata’s spatial data analysis package. Thus, the final, cleaned dataset contains information on each school’s characteristics, as well as underlying census tract characteristics. Vaccination rates are linked on the school’s zip code. <h2>Rescaling Indicators</h2> The diverse indicators that comprise the Student Health Index include percentages, rates, and index values. To include them in a composite measure, each is transformed to enable comparisons on a common scale, using percentiles. Thus, performance on an indicator is compared with the highest and lowest scores obtained on that indicator. Specifically, the index draws on 14 indicators related to socioeconomic factors and health outcomes at the school and neighborhood (census tract) level. Each school is given a score of 1-4 for each indicator, based on the quartile that indicator falls into relative to all other schools. For example, a school with a very high percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals would receive a score of 4, while a school with few such students would receive a score of 1. <h2>Calculating & Weighting the Opportunity Scores & Grades</h2> The calculation methodology was based off the methodologies used by the model indices (see Full Report for more information). Because school-level data is more specific to the individual school context than community-level data, it is double weighted for the purpose of this analysis. All school-level scores are doubled, creating scores of 2-8 for school data. All scores are then added up across all 14 indicators, creating a Need Score ranging from 19 to 73. This score is again broken into four categories using quartiles, which allowed for the creation of the Student Health Index. Each school is thus designated as either highest need, higher need, lower need, and lowest need. <h2>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</h2> The schools included in the Index were selected intentionally based on specified inclusion criteria. California had over 10,000 active public schools at the start of the 2021-22 school year, according to data from the California Department of Education. The goal of this analysis was to create a list of locations to target for additional health care services, and thus for the purpose of this analysis, schools that met certain criteria were excluded from the list of schools that were statistically analyzed. The exclusion criteria are as follows: Using these criteria, a little over 8,000 public schools were selected for relative needs analysis. Schools with existing SBHCs were included in the index, in part so that the CSHA can determine whether these centers are currently located at relatively high need schools. These schools can be filtered out of the online resource and associated dataset according to data users’ interests and needs. Table 2: Number and Type of Schools in Final List Contact us if you would like to receive the complete data set associated with this analysis, including a list of schools included in the index. <h2>Differentiating Rural & Urban Schools</h2> Because rural schools generally are smaller and serve a population with different access to urban infrastructure such as health clinics and public transit, urban and rural schools were analyzed separately. The same indicators were used, but each indicator was given a relative score based on all other schools in the same rural or urban classification. Thus, a high need urban school is ranked only in comparison to other urban schools, and a high need rural school is high need relative to other rural schools.", "modified": "2025-08-07T21:05:38", "slug": "methodology", "status": "publish", "excerpt": "The California Student Health Index was constructed by incorporating information gleaned from the analysis of the landscape of existing indices and publicly available datasets.

{"page_id": 2493, "title": "Chronic Absence", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/chronic-absence/", "content": "<h2>School-Based Health Centers & Wellness Centers Can Help Schools Reduce Absence</h2> Because chronic absenteeism is the result of complex mental, physical, and family health issues, school-based health centers and wellness centers (SBHCs/WCs) can play an integral part in strategically addressing attendance problems. In collaboration with educators, health center staff can identify and support students with unmet health needs so they can re-engage with school. Doing so improves student health and increases school attendance. 1 At Elsa Widenmann Elementary School in Vallejo City Unified School District, educators saw an opportunity to reduce absenteeism by establishing a school-based health center. As former principal MaBella Gonzales explains, “Our concern was attendance, and how many non-urgent health needs were preventing children from coming to school. As we worked with our collaborative partners [to establish our new school-based health center] we wanted to create a hub for our school community where information and resources were available to support the health, well-being and positive lifestyles of students and families.” <h2>Steps to Reduce Chronic Absence</h2> <h3>1. Work with Administrators and the Attendance Office</h3> Establish a mechanism for working with administrators and the attendance office to identify students who are chronically absent and have them referred to the school-based health center (SBHC). If you are able to participate in the school’s analysis of attendance data, you may find the following tools useful; if you are not able to participate in that process for privacy reasons, you may want to share the tools with school partners. <h4>Tools for Collecting and Analyzing Student Attendance Data</h4> <h3>2. Participate in the School’s Absenteeism Intervention Team</h3> This team should use an interdisciplinary process to identify and respond to the needs of chronically absent students. Such teams may be focused on attendance (e.g. School Attendance Review Team, or SART) or may address students’ needs more broadly (e.g. Coordination of Services Team, or COST). If your school does not have such a team, the health center should consider spearheading this effort. <h4>Learn More About SARTs:</h4> <h4>Learn More About Related State-Level Efforts:</h4> <h3>3. Conduct Health and Psychosocial Assessments</h3> Conduct health and psychosocial assessments of chronically absent students and then either deliver indicated services or refer them to additional services not provided by your school health center. When possible, help patients and families make appointments with outside providers to ensure access to care. One successful example of a nurse practitioner-led effort to conduct assessments with chronically absent students is outlined in this research article: Does Contact by a Family Nurse Practitioner Decrease Early School Absence? <h3>4. Interview Chronically Absent Students and Families</h3> Interview chronically absent students and families to better understand the barriers to school attendance that they are experiencing and the types of incentives and supports that will re-engage them in school. This is particularly important for high school students, as they are more likely to make their own decisions about whether or not they will attend school, so attendance incentives should be determined by the teens they target. <h3>5. Consult with School Administrators on Disciplinary Policies</h3> Consult with school administrators on disciplinary policies to promote progressive disciplinary policies that address the causes of misbehavior rather than suspending or expelling students. <h3>6. Conduct Home Visits</h3> When you can’t reach chronically absent students or their families at school, conduct home visits to make personal contact. When possible, perform home visits in partnership with another school or health center staff member. When you find a student or family member at home, establish a non-threatening, non-judgmental approach by conveying your concern about the student’s absence, and inquiring as to how you might be able to help him/her attend school more regularly. It is not important to enter the home; even a brief conversation at the door and a personal invitation to come to the health center will help to build trust with the student and family. <h4>Home Visiting Resources and Training Opportunities</h4> <h3>7. Provide Case Management</h3> Provide ongoing, individual case management for chronically absent students and families. <h4>Case Management Resources and Training Opportunities</h4> 1 Lewallen, T., Hunt, H., Potts-Datema, W., Zaza, S., Giles, W.

So it just makes sense to have a school-based health clinic as a key component to providing a quality education. Students feel it: Our school health center has everything! Comfort. Respect. Honesty. School is a hard place for many young people. They might be labeled as ‘low achieving’ or ‘angry,’ ‘apathetic’ or ‘defiant.’ When these young people come into a space that lifts up their hopes and dreams, they are able to re-position themselves in their own lives and within the school community as activists, artists, advocates and leaders. This chance to matter, to be an agent of change, has a profound impact on young people’s sense of themselves and their imaginative capacity to hold a positive future.

School mental health services are wide and varied across the 10,000 California K-12 schools, and as funding for public education in California continues to lag far behind other states, the availability of trained school personnel to support student mental health is nowhere near the levels needed. One important source of mental health care for children and adolescents arrives through the state’s 293 school-based health centers (SBHCs). SBHCs provide access to care for 280,000 students annually and two thirds of centers offer mental health services such as individual and group counseling that is tailored to the needs of students and integrated with their primary care. Among those reached are those who experience mental health conditions or disorders as well as a much larger number who face concerns related to social determinants of health, trauma or adverse childhood experiences (ACES), substance misuse/abuse, and various other risk behaviors. The screening that leads to a mental health referral in SBHCs often comes from a trusted medical provider, health educator or peer. <h2>Behavioral Health Sustainability Guide</h2> For School-Based Health Centers operated by FQHCs <h3>ADDRESSING THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS</h3> School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) in California provide access to care for 280,000 youth annually. The values and mission of SBHCs includes a commitment to providing access to behavioral health care to address child and adolescent mental health conditions, social determinants of health, and adverse childhood experiences. Current trends in health outcomes in the United States expose an underlying concern about existing models of medical and traditional mental health care and their ability to treat the real causes and conditions that are driving today’s greatest health challenges for children and adolescents. Research demonstrates that traditional medical care does not have the greatest impact on children and adolescent health outcomes, but instead a combination of individual health behaviors, mental health supports (both prevention and treatment) and addressing of social determinants of health. Environmental factors are also known to have a great impact on health, and there is a positive correlation between health outcomes and protective factors which include having safe and supportive relationships. <h3>Related Resources</h3> <h4>Certified Wellness Coaches: Voices from California’s New Wellness Support Profession</h4> October 29, 2025: Hear directly from Certified Wellness Coaches (CWCs) currently working in California schools and wellness centers.

{"page_id": 2432, "title": "Mandated Services", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/mandated-services/", "content": "Some health services are required for all students by California Education Code or Health and Safety Code , and others are required for certain students as outlined in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) . These services are typically provided by school personnel, such as school nurses, but they may be provided by other staff depending on the level of service and related legal or credentialing requirements. School nurses play a critical role in supporting the health, wellness, and academic success of students nationwide ( NASN ). As registered nurses, school nurses can provide primary prevention (e.g., implement immunization compliance and education), secondary prevention through assessments (e.g., conduct vision and hearing screenings), tertiary prevention through the delivery of health services (e.g., administer and train on insulin and medical procedures), and provide health education to students, families and staff. They coordinate school or district-wide health programs. Read more about the role of school nurses or visit the California School Nurses Organization website. <h2>Primary Mandated School Health Services</h2> The primary mandated school health services are: <h3>Immunization Compliance</h3> School nurses are responsible for ensuring all students are up to date in their vaccinations/immunizations ( NASN , EC4942(a) ) in compliance with California law . Students should only be admitted to school if they have all required immunizations;  are not currently due for immunizations, but have doses due later; or fit into an “Other” category of exemptions. If requirements are not met, parents should be referred to their doctor with a notice of immunizations needed . <h3>Exemptions</h3> As of January 1, 2016 only Medical Exemptions may be accepted to exempt students from Immunization requirements in California. Personal Belief Exemptions in place prior to that date were grandfathered in. As exemptions must be renewed at each grade span, no remaining students should have a Personal Belief Exemption on file. Only Medical Exemptions transmitted through the California Department of Public Health’s (CDPH) electronic database known as CAIR-ME may be accepted. Written notes exempting students from Immunizations or confirming a child has previously had varicella (chickenpox) may not be accepted. Information about Medical Exemptions may be found at the CDPH website . Medical exemptions may not be accepted from physicians who have been disciplined. To determine whether a physician has been disciplined, see the letter from CDPH . <h3>Homeless Education</h3> The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (McKinney-Vento Act) (42 United States Code § 11431-11435) is federal legislation that ensures the educational rights and protections of children and youth experiencing homelessness. Schools are required to allow homeless children and youth to attend school while immunization and other health records and screenings are obtained. Schools are required to work with and assist parents to obtain immunizations and other health information while attending school. See the California Department of Education guidance on Homeless Education . <h3>Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine</h3> As of January 1, 2024, the Cancer Prevention Act requires all schools to notify 6th grade students and their parents or guardians they are advised to follow current HPV immunization guidelines before starting 8th grade. Notifications must include: <h3>Special Education-Related Services</h3> These include health assessments and treatments required for students with disabilities, as indicated by a student’s Individualized Education Program (IEP) and as outlined in IDEA. School nurses, school psychologists, speech therapists and other health professionals may be involved in both initial and triennial special education health assessments, as well as indicated treatments, such as gastric tube feedings or catheterizations. Health assessments must be conducted by a credentialed school nurse or physician as noted in EC 56324(b) . <h3>School-Based Prescription Medication Administration</h3> Many students require administration of  prescription medications during school hours. Any student who is required to take medication prescribed or ordered for them by a physician may be assisted by the school nurse or other designated school personnel trained and overseen by the school nurse if the school district receives (1) a written statement from such physician detailing the method, amount, and time schedules by which such medication is to be taken and (2) a written statement from the parent or guardian of the student indicating the desire that the school district assist the student in the matters set forth in the physician’s statement. See the California Department of Education guidance on Medication Administration . <h3>Vision, Hearing, & Scoliosis Screenings</h3> These are required at specific intervals and grade levels in California. Schools must conduct vision screening on all students upon school entry and every third year thereafter through grade eight. For example, vision testing may be done in kindergarten or first grade and in grades two, five, and eight, as well as on enrollment and referral at any grade level. Learn more about vision screening . Hearing screening is mandated in kindergarten/first grade and in second, fifth, eighth, tenth/eleventh grade and upon first school entry (California Code of Regulations, Title 17, Section 2952 (c)(1)) . Hearing screening in California public schools must be conducted by a credentialed school audiometrist. See the School Audiometrist Manual . Note that local education agencies (LEA) may apply for a waiver for the high school hearing testing requirement. The state scoliosis screening mandate was suspended and it is uncertain whether it will be reinstated. Some school districts may have a policy to conduct scoliosis screenings for girls in seventh grade and boys in eighth grade. Learn more about scoliosis screening . <h2>Other Health Requirements</h2> <h3>Tuberculosis Screening</h3> The California TB Controllers Association (CTCA) Position on TB Evaluation of School-Age Children continues to recommend risk-based school entry TB screening using the California Pediatric Tuberculosis Risk Assessment . Recommendations for TB evaluation of school-age children should be guided by the local public health department. Ideally, TB risk assessment should be done in the medical home and provided to the school district. School nurses may complete the TB risk assessment with an urgent referral to a medical home in the case of a positive screen. <h3>Kindergarten Oral Health Assessment (KOHA)</h3> The Kindergarten Oral Health Assessment (KOHA) requirement was passed into law in 2005 by Assembly Bill 1433 (AB 1433) under the Education Code Section 49452.8 . In 2025, Assembly Bill 2630 specifies “kindergarten” to include both transitional kindergarten (TK) and kindergarten, requiring children enrolled in public school for their first year in transitional kindergarten (TK), kindergarten, or first grade to have an oral health screening completed by a licensed dental professional. <h3>Emergency Medication</h3> Stock epinephrine : LEAs are required to stock epinephrine Opioid antagonists : LEAs may choose to stock opioid antagonists Stock albuterol : LEAs may choose to stock opioid antagonists See other resources on oral health screening , and school health requirements for certain immunizations .", "modified": "2025-11-04T01:31:20", "slug": "mandated-services", "status": "publish", "excerpt": "Some health services are required for all students by California Education Code or Health and Safety Code, and others are required for certain students as outlined in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).

Children and adolescents are especially vulnerable to these effects. <h3>Explore Our Trauma-Informed Content</h3> At the California School-Based Health Alliance (CSHA), we support trauma-informed, healing-centered, and resilience-focused approaches in schools and school-based wellness centers across California. We also recognize the impact of sociocultural trauma—including racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, ableism, classism, and other forms of systemic oppression—which shapes students’ everyday experiences and can intensify traditional forms of trauma, such as violence, natural disasters, medical trauma, and loss. <h3>Practices</h3> <h3>Interventions</h3> <h3>Assessment Tool</h3> Creating trauma-informed schools requires addressing this full spectrum of trauma with cultural humility and a deep commitment to ongoing reflection on power, privilege, and equity.

Container trucks carry goods to and from the Port of Oakland, U.S. Postal Service trucks carry mail to a major distribution center, and trucks and automobiles move overhead on freeways that surround the community.(6) The California Air Resources Board (CARB) conducted a health risk assessment and reported that West Oakland residents are exposed to high concentrations of diesel particulate matter—almost three times higher than the average background levels in the Bay Area.(7) The population is predominantly African-American and 35% of residents live below the federal poverty line.(8) Asthma is a significant public health concern for this community. Rates for Emergency Department visits due to asthma are higher in Alameda County than for the state and West Oakland children go to the Emergency Department with asthma almost twice as often as the county average. The West Oakland Middle School has 220 students enrolled and over 50 have been diagnosed with asthma and many more report undiagnosed respiratory concerns. The West Oakland Middle School (WOMS) Health Center recognized the disproportionate burden of asthma in their community and chose to prioritize asthma as one of the key health issues they address at their clinic. Run by Lifelong Medical, the WOMS Health Center developed an asthma management program based on national clinical guidelines. Components of their asthma management program include: Although spirometry is only used by 52% of providers, we know that it is an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of asthma and are committed to providing the highest standard of care . Kristine Carter, Nurse Practitioner They also conduct asthma education in a group setting at their clinic. They work with an AmeriCorps: Community Health Corp volunteer to conduct the foursession training which covers: what asthma is; recognizing symptoms; understanding medications; and identifying and reducing exposure to environmental triggers at home, school, and in the community. Students are hesitant about coming to class, but are always excited to share what they have learned and used . Aaron Steinfeld, Community Health Corp Volunteer The staff at the WOMS Health Center were eager to strengthen their asthma program in the fall by adding a component that directly addresses the air pollution in West Oakland through implementing the EPA’s Flag Program. The Flag Program uses different colored flags to inform students, school staff, and the community of daily air quality conditions. The flag colors correspond to the colors used in EPA’s Air Quality Index (AQI), which tells how clean or polluted the air is for that day. Sharing the daily air quality through these highly visible flags increases awareness about air pollution. In addition to raising awareness, the flag program also serves as important guidance for modifying physical activity in order to protect the health and well-being of students. We know that our program is working and we’re excited to expand it to other locations to help children all across Oakland breathe easier . Hana Shirriel-Dia, Health Center Supervisor In addition to expanding the breadth of their asthma program, the staff have plans to expand their reach. They will be expanding their own clinic services to include students from a nearby Charter Middle School. Additionally, they plan to replicate their comprehensive asthma program in another school-based health center run by Lifelong Medical in East Oakland, CA.

One of the most important is determining which confidentiality laws control access to and disclosure of the school-based health programs’ health care information. <h3>HIPAA or FERPA?</h3> While there may be multiple laws to consider, the first question to address is whether the program’s information is subject to the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) or the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). <h3>Feeling Unsure?</h3> There are a number of common questions regarding school-based health as well as HIPAA and FERPA. Below are links to role-based frequently asked HIPAA – FERPA questions relating to the records and communication of a… Parent/Guardian Medical Provider School Administrator Behavioral Health Provider School Nurse Student <h2>Navigating HIPAA and FERPA for Integrated School Behavioral Health Services</h2> California Health and Human Services Agency (CalHHS) has released a toolkit designed to help Local Educational Agencies (LEAs) navigate the complexities of privacy and confidentiality while promoting effective coordination of care. It outlines best practices and key considerations for maintaining trust with students and families while ensuring compliance with legal requirements. <h2>Key Points About HIPAA FERPA in California</h2> Whether HIPAA or FERPA applies and how those laws interact with state confidentiality law will impact school-based health service operations in large and small ways: <h3>How HIPAA & FERPA Interact</h3> The following video includes content based on laws, not ethics, clinic policy, or best practice. Simply because you can share information without an authorization form in some instances, doesn’t mean you always should. Sometimes ethics and your client relationship are more critical. Other times, your clinic policy recommends or requires that you obtain client consent/authorization before making a disclosure. This video provides legal information only and is accurate as of June 2020. To understand how this information might apply to you or to a specific situation, please seek legal counsel for specific advice. The content for this video was developed by Rebecca Gudeman at the National Center for Youth Law in partnership with the California School-Based Health Alliance. <h3>What is HIPAA?</h3> The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule is a federal law that protects the privacy of patient health information held by “covered entities.” 1 <h4>What information is protected under HIPAA?</h4> The HIPAA Privacy Rule limits covered health providers from disclosing what HIPAA calls “protected health information” (PHI). 8 “Protected health information” is individually identifiable health information in any form, including oral communications as well as written or electronically transmitted information. 9 Protected health information does not include information subject to FERPA. HIPAA explicitly states that health information held in an education record subject to FERPA is not “protected health information.” 10 In other words, if FERPA applies, HIPAA does not, and FERPA and HIPAA can never apply to the same information at the same time. <h4>How do HIPAA and California law intersect?</h4> California has its own laws that protect the confidentiality of medical and mental health information. 11 One of the most comprehensive set of statutes is called the California  Confidentiality of  Medical Information Act  (CMIA) .  It applies to medical information held by the health care providers, health care services plans and contractors, as each is defined in state law. 12 The CMIA parallels HIPAA in many ways; however, in some situations, it actually provides greater confidentiality protections than HIPAA. Federal privacy regulations under HIPAA usually supersede – or “preempt” – state laws, but HIPAA states that if a state’s law is more protective of individual privacy, then providers should follow the state law. 13 Thus, California health providers typically are following both HIPAA and state law. There are two other ways that California law becomes particularly important to understanding HIPAA. HIPAA grants rights to sign authorizations and to access a minor’s protected health information based in part on who is authorized to make health decisions for the minor. State law determines who has those consent rights in many cases. 14 Similarly, HIPAA says a parent’s right to access records when the parent did not consent for the child’s care will depend in part on state law. Finally, it is important to note that in addition to state and federal statute, licensed health professionals may practice under state ethical and licensing regulations that also include obligations related to confidentiality. These principles may impose greater confidentiality obligations than HIPAA. <h4>What administrative requirements must a provider satisfy under HIPAA?</h4> If a provider operates under HIPAA, it must meet all the administrative requirements in HIPAA and CMIA. This includes but is not limited to making sure the provider has a HIPAA-compliant “Notice of Privacy Practices” that it shares with clients 28 , a HIPAA and CMIA-compliant release form (See Requirements for Release of Information Forms in Additional Resources) , and that it maintains records for the appropriate number of years, among many other things. Providers subject to HIPAA should consult their legal counsel regarding the many administrative requirements in HIPAA. <h4>What is the HIPAA/CMIA confidentiality rule?</h4> Generally, health care providers cannot disclose information protected by HIPAA and without a signed authorization. 15 An authorization form must include specific elements to be valid under HIPAA and CMIA. (See Requirements for Release of Information Forms in Additional Resources. ) 16 HIPAA and California law also define who must sign the authorization. 17 <h5>Who signs an authorization to release health information under HIPAA and CMIA?</h5> A parent, guardian or another person with authority under the law to make health decisions for an unemancipated minor usually must sign authorizations to release the minor’s information. 18 However, if the minor consented or could have consented for the health care under California’s minor consent laws for the health care, the minor must sign the authorization. Some of California’s minor consent laws are highlighted in Covered Entities in Additional Resources. <h5>Real World Example</h5> Jake, 16, needs a general physical. He is authorized to consent to his own health care under California law because he is 15-years-old or older, not living with his parents, and managing his own financial affairs. Because he can consent to his own care, he can sign authorizations to release the related health information. (See California Minor Consent Laws in Additional Resources.) <h5>Do exceptions in HIPAA and CMIA allow release of information without written authorization?</h5> The default rule in HIPAA and CMIA is that release of protected health information requires a signed authorization; however, there are many exceptions to this rule. Exceptions in HIPAA and CMIA allow, and sometimes require, health care providers to share health and mental health information without the need of a signed release. A few examples of these exceptions include: Different conditions must be met before information may be shared under each exception. For example, the “treatment” exception under HIPAA and CMIA only allows a health provider to disclose information to other providers of health care, health care service plans, contractors, or other health care professionals or facilities and only for purposes of diagnosis or treatment of the patient. So, it is important to understand the law before relying on an exception to disclose protected health information. <h3>What is FERPA?</h3> The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects the privacy of students’ personal records held by “educational agencies or institutions” that receive federal funds under programs administered by the U.S. Secretary of Education. 29 <h4>What are the general requirements of FERPA?</h4> Generally, FERPA prohibits educational agencies from releasing any information in the education record unless they have written permission for the release. 42 In most cases, a parent 43 must sign that release. Requirements for a FERPA-compliant release can be found in Requirements for Release of Information Forms in Additional Resources. When students are eighteen years old or older, they sign their own release forms. FERPA also requires educational agencies to allow parents to access their minor children’s education records. <h4>What information does FERPA protect?</h4> FERPA controls disclosure of recorded information maintained in the “education record.” “Education records” are defined as records, files, documents, or other materials that contain information directly related to a student and are maintained by an educational agency or institution, or a person acting for such agency or institution. 32 “Information directly related to a student” means any information “that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community . . . to identify the student with reasonable certainty.” 33 FERPA does not apply to all information at a school exchanged by school staff. For example, communications that are not recorded in any form, such as the contents of a conversation between a teacher and student in a hallway, are not part of the education record and are not subject to FERPA. There also are several types of records that are exempted from FERPA. For purposes of school based health care, the most relevant exemptions include: <h5>Real World Example</h5> A teacher personally witnesses an incident, such as one student bullying another. Can the teacher call the victim’s parents and tell them what she observed and who she saw bullying their child? Yes. This is because FERPA prohibits the improper disclosure of information derived from education records. Therefore, information that is based on observation or hearsay and not specifically contained in education records would not be protected from disclosures under FERPA. Source: U.S. Department of Education’s Family Policy Compliance Office. <h4>How does FERPA intersect with California Law?</h4> Records that are kept in the sole possession of the maker, are used only as a personal memory aid, and are not accessible or revealed to any other person except a temporary substitute for the maker of the record 34 Treatment records of a student 18 and older when used only in connection with treatment and not made available to anyone other than those providing treatment 35 California has state laws that protect the confidentiality of information held by schools. 49 For the most part, the rules and exceptions in California law parallel those found in FERPA. 50 To the extent that provisions of FERPA conflict with state law or regulation, FERPA usually preempts state law. If an educational agency believes there is an actual conflict between obligations under state law and its ability to comply with FERPA, the educational agency must notify the U.S. Department of Education’s Family Policy Compliance Office. 51 If a school employee believes there may be a conflict between FERPA and California law, they should contact their school district legal counsel. <h4>What administrative requirements must a health provider with records subject to FERPA satisfy?</h4> If a school based health program has records subject to FERPA, it must meet all the administrative requirements in FERPA. Among other things, this includes: It includes other considerations as well. The National Forum on Education Statistics has a guide to implementing FERPA. 55 Requirements for a compliant release form can be found in Requirements for Release of Information Forms in Additional Resources, and the U.S. Department of Education provides several model notices for educational agencies. 56 <h3>FAQs</h3> <h4>HIPAA</h4> HIPAA defines “covered entity” as health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers who transmit health information in electronic form related to certain types of transactions. 2 “Health care providers” who “transmit health information in electronic form” are “covered entities” and must comply with HIPAA. “Health care providers” are defined to include both individual providers such as physicians, clinical social workers, and other medical and mental health practitioners, as well as hospitals, clinics and other organizations. 3 Health care providers are only subject to HIPAA, however, if they transmit health information regarding certain types of health transactions electronically. The transactions that will make HIPAA applicable include any of the following when done electronically: submitting claims to health insurers, making benefit and coverage inquiries to insurers, making inquiries about submitted claims, and sending health care authorization requests, among others. 4 The fact that a school based program or provider may not use electronic records onsite does not automatically mean it is exempt from HIPAA. Providers may be transmitting electronic health information in another way, for example, by using a billing service that does. That said, there will be providers who are not subject to HIPAA because they do not transmit health information in electronic form related  to covered transactions. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services offers a “Covered Entity Chart” that a provider can use to determine whether the provider is subject to HIPAA. 5 (See Covered Entities for further information.) Even if a health provider meets the definition of “covered entity,” some of its records may be subject to FERPA instead of HIPAA when working at or with a school. (See HIPAA, FERPA, Both or Neither? A Flowchart for Decision-Making .) Most covered entities work with other organizations and individuals in order to provide health care. Examples include attorneys, data processors, and accountants. A “business associate” is an individual  or  organization that receives, creates, maintains, or transmits “protected health information” as part of certain types of work it does on behalf of a covered entity. The type of work must be directly related to activities the covered entity does that are regulated by HIPAA, such as claims processing or billing, or services that support that work such as legal, actuarial, transcription, accounting, consulting, management, accreditation, or financial services. 6 (See endnote 6 for more examples.) In most cases, the covered entity must enter into a business associate contract with this individual or organization in order to share protected health information. Indirectly, yes. A covered entity cannot share information with a business associate unless the covered entity has received written assurances from the business associate that the business associate will protect “protected health information” in compliance with HIPAA. HIPAA outlines what this written agreement must include before a covered entity may share health information with the business associate. These contracts cannot obligate a business associate to do something that otherwise conflicts with other laws, however, such as FERPA. Providers always should consult legal counsel regarding such contracts and whether an organization qualifies as a “business associate” in the first place. 7 <h4>FERPA</h4> “Educational agencies or institutions” are defined as institutions that provide direct instruction to students, such as schools; as well as educational agencies that direct or control schools, including school districts and state education departments. 30 Almost all public schools and public school districts receive some form of federal education funding and must comply with FERPA. Organizations and individuals that contract with or consult for an educational agency also may be subject to FERPA if certain conditions are met. 31 These conditions are discussed later on in greater detail later on. FERPA contains exceptions that allow agencies and schools to disclose information absent a written release in some circumstances. For example, schools may share “directory information” 44 about students with the public generally if the school and district have given public notice to parents about the types of information the school and district consider directory information, the parents’ right to refuse directory disclosures, and how long parents have to inform the school or district about their intent to opt out. 45 Another exception allows school staff to share information with “school  officials” 46 in the same educational agency who have a “legitimate educational interest” in the information. 47 This exception is further discussed in the answer to “Are treatment or health records in an education file treated differently than other types of information in the file?” above . Certain policies must be in place at the district level in order to implement both of these exceptions. Additional exceptions also exist, including exceptions that allow sharing information in emergency situations with contractors, and for school transfers, among others. 48 The emergency exception is discussed further in School Nurses Frequently Asked Questions in the answer to “ Does FERPA still apply if a school nurse is hired with funds from an agency not subject to FERPA such as a foundation or the Department of Health?”. California law says  that “information of a personal nature” 52 disclosed by a student 12 and older, or the student’s parents, to a school counselor 53 as part of receiving “educational counseling” 54 (as defined in state law) does not become part of the pupil record, and access to that information is very limited. 55 (See endnote for limitations.) The statute goes on to say that “[i]t is the intent of the Legislature that counselors use the privilege of confidentiality under this section to assist the pupil whenever possible to communicate more effectively with parents, school staff, and others.” Before relying on this rule, it is critical to discuss this law with school district legal counsel to understand its scope and any possible conflicts with FERPA. Student health records maintained by a school or school employees, such as treatment records, IEP assessments, or immunization documents, are part of the education file in almost all cases .37 FERPA does not treat health and mental health records in a minor’s education file differently than it does any other information, such as grades or demographic information in the file. 38 That said, FERPA generally limits access to all student records, and for example, only school staff with a “legitimate educational interest” in the information should be able to access it. FERPA requires schools to include in their annual notices to parents a statement indicating whether the school has a policy of disclosing information from the education file to school officials, and, if so, which parties are considered school officials for this purpose and what the school considers to be a “legitimate educational interest.” 39 There is one small exception. Some treatment records are not part of the “education record.” Records of treatment provided students who are 18 and older, created by a medical provider, only used for treatment purposes and not shared with others are not subject to FERPA. This is a very limited exception, however. These records become a part of the education file and are subject to FERPA as soon as the records are used for anything beyond treatment or shared with anyone other than providers — for example, disclosed to the parent or shared to obtain reimbursement for the care. Records of a law enforcement unit mean those records, files, documents, and other materials that are (i) Created by a law enforcement unit; (ii) Created for a law enforcement purpose; and (iii) Maintained by the law enforcement unit. 40 Law enforcement unit records are not considered part of the “education record” and are not subject to FERPA. The law enforcement unit of a school is any individual, office, department, division, or other component of an educational agency or institution, such as a unit of commissioned police officers or non-commissioned security guards, that  is  officially authorized or designated by that agency or institution to: For information on how and when schools can disclose information to law enforcement and the law enforcement unit at a school, please consult school district counsel. The U.S. Department of Education provides this guidance: “ ‘Law enforcement unit records’ (i.e., records created by the law enforcement unit, created for a law enforcement purpose, and maintained by the law enforcement unit) are not ‘education records’ subject to the privacy protections of FERPA. As such, the law enforcement unit may refuse to provide a parent or eligible student with an opportunity to inspect and review law enforcement unit records, and it may disclose law enforcement unit records to third parties without the parent or eligible student’s prior written consent. However, education records, or personally identifiable information from education records, which the school shares with the law enforcement unit, do not lose their protected status as education records just because they are shared with the law enforcement unit.” Source: U.S. Dept. of Education, “ Are law enforcement records considered education records ?” available at https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/faq/are-law-enforcement-records-considered-education-records Sole possession records are records that are kept in the sole possession of the maker, are used only as a personal memory aid, and are not accessible or revealed to any other person except a temporary substitute. Sole possession records are not considered part of the education record and are not subject to FERPA. These records become a part of the education file and are subject to FERPA, however, as soon as they are shared with anyone other than a temporary substitute for the maker. The U.S. Department of Education provides this guidance: “Generally sole possession records are of the nature to serve as a ‘memory jogger’ for the creator of the record. For example, if a school official has taken notes regarding telephone or face to face conversations, such notes could be sole possession records depending on the nature and content of the notes.” The DOE also cautions in its guidance: “Once the contents or information recorded in sole possession records is disclosed to any party other than a temporary substitute for the maker of the records, those records become education records subject to FERPA.” Source: U.S. Dept. of Education, “ What records are exempted from FERPA? ” available at: https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/faq/what-records-are-exempted-ferpa <h3>Additional Resources</h3> <h4>Endnotes</h4> 1 45 C.F.R. § 160.103.

{"page_id": 133, "title": "Student Behavioral Health Implementation Guide", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/student-mental-health-implementation-guide/", "content": "<h3>Introduction</h3> This guide is intended to support local education agencies (LEAs) and county behavioral health departments (BHDs) as they partner to deliver comprehensive, high-quality school mental health services for California students. These collaborative efforts can be challenging, and although helpful information and tools exist, they are spread out in many different places. The goal of this resource is to create a library of accessible tools organized around critical topics and challenges. Each section includes an overview of the topic and a collection of related resources. A glossary below is included for your convenience. <h3>Definition of Common Terms & Acronyms</h3> AB 114, Special Education Transition Signed in 2011, this law ended the state mandate on county mental health agencies to provide mental health services to students with disabilities. After the passage of AB 114, school districts are solely responsible for ensuring that students with disabilities receive special education and related services, including some services previously arranged for or provided by county mental health agencies. In some cases, school districts still contract with counties, or county-contracted providers, to provide mental health services to special education students. CMAA = County Medicaid Administrative Activities Participating local governmental agencies are eligible to receive Federal reimbursement for the cost of performing administrative activities that directly support efforts to identify and enroll potentially eligible individuals into Medi-Cal, and to remove barriers to Medi-Cal services. Eligible activities include outreach to the general population and high-risk populations, facilitating Medi-Cal applications, contracting for Medi-Cal services, and program planning and policy development. CYBHI = Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative Five-year, multi-billion dollar state initiative launched in 2021 to create a more integrated, youth-centered system of support that allows youth to find mental health and substance use needs where, when and in the way they need it. CYBHI is comprised of over 20 workstreams, and includes programs focused on California’s behavioral health workforce, ecosystem infrastructure, health coverage, and public awareness. EPSDT = Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment An enhanced Medicaid benefit that requires states to screen for and provide services necessary to ameliorate physical and mental health conditions for all persons under age 21 who are eligible. Under EPSDT, young people who qualify for full scope Medi-Cal (or Medicaid) with mental health conditions that meet medical necessity are entitled to services including, but not limited to, the following: mental health assessment, collateral contacts, therapy, rehabilitation, mental health services, medication support services, day rehabilitation, day treatment intensive, crisis intervention/stabilization, targeted case management, and therapeutic behavioral services. EPSDT Specialty Mental Health Refers to the “moderate to severe” Medi-Cal mental health benefits that county behavioral health agencies are responsible. Medi-Cal Managed Care Organizations (MCOs, i.e. health plans) are largely responsible for the rest of the EPSDT benefit for beneficiaries under age 21. ERMHS = Educationally Related Mental Health Services These services are provided when special education students have significant social, emotional and/or behavioral needs that impede their ability to benefit from their special education services, supports, and placement. Services must be included in the Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) and can include individual counseling, parent counseling, social work services, psychological services, and residential treatment. IEP = Individualized Education Plan This is a plan or program developed to ensure that a child with an identified disability who is attending an elementary or secondary educational institution receives specialized instruction and related services. ISF = Interconnected Systems Framework A structure and process to integrate Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) and School Mental Health within school systems. The goal is to blend resources, training, systems, data, and practices in order to improve outcomes for all children and youth. LCAP = Local Control Accountability Plan A tool for local educational agencies (LEAs) to set goals, plan actions, and leverage resources to meet those goals to improve student outcomes. The plan is aligned with state funding that LEAs receive to achieve those goals and support the overall functioning of the LEA. LEA = Local Education Agency A local entity involved in education including but not limited to school districts, county offices of education, direct-funded charter schools, and special education local plan area (SELPA). MHSA = Mental Health Services Act Created in 2004 with the passage of Proposition 63, which levied a 1 percent tax on personal income above $1 million. MHSA provides the state’s second largest public funding stream for mental health services, after Medi-Cal. MHSA programs and services are intended to enhance, rather than replace, existing programs. A majority of MHSA funding goes to counties and counties are required to submit three-year program and expenditure plans and annual updates. MHSSA = Mental Health Student Services Act Funded by the Mental Health Services Act, MHSSA provides grants for partnerships between county mental health agencies and local education agencies to deliver school-based mental health services to young people and their families. MOU = Memorandum of Understanding An agreement between two parties that is not legally binding, but which outlines the responsibilities of each of the parties to the agreement. These agreements may describe the relationship between counties, LEAs, and community provider(s) and outline the responsibilities and expectations of partnerships between the various entities. MTSS = Multi-Tiered System of Support An integrated, comprehensive framework that focuses on Common Core State Standards, core instruction, differentiated learning, student-centered learning, individualized student needs, and the alignment of systems necessary for all students’ academic, behavioral, and social success. PEI = Prevention and Early Intervention One of five categories of expenditures in MHSA. This category is intended to fund programs and services that intervene early prior to the development of serious mental health issues and catch mental health issues in their earliest stages to prevent long-term suffering.  PEI programs emphasize strategies to reduce negative outcomes that may result from untreated mental illness: suicide, incarcerations, school failure or dropout, unemployment, prolonged suffering, homelessness, and removal of children from their homes. PBIS = Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports A framework for enhancing the adoption and implementation of a continuum of evidence-based interventions to achieve academically and behaviorally important outcomes for all students. As a “framework,” the emphasis is on a process or approach, rather than a curriculum, intervention, or practice. The “continuum” notion emphasizes how evidence- or research-based behavioral practices are organized within a multi-tiered system of support. SELPA = Special Education Local Plan Area Consortiums in geographical regions with sufficient size and scope to provide for all special education service needs of children residing within the region boundaries. Each region develops a local plan describing how it would provide special education services. SELPAs vary in size: some serve just one school district, some serve multiple school districts, some serve an entire county. SBHIP = Student Behavioral Health Incentive Program A workstream of CYBHI, SBHIP was launched in CY 2022 and funding concludes in December 2024. SBHIP provides financial incentives to increase coordination among Medi-Cal managed care plans and local education agencies to improve access to and delivery of mental health services. <h4>This Guide Created in Partnership With</h4>", "modified": "2025-08-28T23:11:24", "slug": "student-mental-health-implementation-guide", "status": "publish", "excerpt": "Introduction This guide is intended to support local education agencies (LEAs) and county behavioral health departments (BHDs) as they partner to deliver comprehensive, high-quality school mental health services for California students. These collaborative efforts can be challenging, and although helpful information and tools exist, they are spread out in many different places.

She currently serves as the Wellness Counselor at Sierra High School (SHS) in San Bernardino, where her leadership has played a key role in the school being named one of America’s Healthiest Schools for two consecutive years and a member of the Recognized ASCA Model Program (RAMP) team. Driven by her personal journey, Yesenia is passionate about advocating for historically underserved youth, working as a catalyst for change. She partners with community-based organizations to provide students with access to evidence-based therapies and physical health services and has established a resource center that is open to the entire community. <h3>Developing & Implementing Universal Screening Efforts at a Wellness Center</h3> Schools are a critical provider of services to address the socio-emotional, behavioral health, and basic needs of students. Universal screening offers one avenue for systematically evaluating, identifying, and monitoring the needs of an entire student population. Acknowledging the reality of limited school-based resources for supporting ongoing screening efforts, this workshop will review the development and beta implementation of a novel digital system that enables identification of at-risk students via the administration of brief, psychometrically valid measures; expedited identification and referral to relevant services via automatic scoring and filtering; as well as ongoing progress tracking at individual and school-wide levels. Presenter: Shayna Greenberg , MA, PhD Student, Loma Linda University <h3>What Drives Student Health: Integrating Social Drivers of Health & Equity</h3> This workshop explores the impact of social drivers of health (SDOH) on student well-being and academic achievement, framed within the Whole Child, Whole School, Whole Community (WSCC) model. Participants will gain insights into how SDOH affects student well-being and academic success. The session will highlight the importance of integrating equity and justice into these discussions, emphasizing the establishment of student health centers as a key strategy.

This has been a growing concern across California, leading to adverse child outcomes. To help address these needs, California Health and Human Services has made an unprecedented $4.7 billion investment to reimagine integrated ecosystems called the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative (CYBHI). In this presentation, you will hear how the CYBHI workstreams are supporting opportunities to improve outcomes for children.

The Program empowers IEHP Members to easily access preventive services and receive care for their chronic conditions (i.e., Asthma, etc.). The Program promotes appropriate utilization of health care services such as: the afterhours Nurse Advice Line Urgent Care Clinics, and Primary Care Providers to ensure Members receive the care they need when they need it and at the right place and at the right time. This promotion of appropriate health care utilization will ensure students are in school ready to learn! The HN will also make sure to connect students and their families to community and Health Plan resources based on need. As a program, we intend to form strong partnerships with school staff (counselors, health aides, Principals, teachers, office personnel, etc.) to help support the students/families in need in areas of physical, mental, and social wellbeing. Presenter: Sonia Rivas , Health Navigator Program Manager, Inland Empire Health Plan <h3>Transforming Our Partnerships for Student Success: Addressing Behavioral Health and Non-Academic Needs in an Upstream and Universal Manner</h3> This workshop will share the successes and learnings from a 4-year partnership between Riverside University Health System and Hemet Unified School District. Through a system of tiered behavioral health services, universal holistic health screening, and onsite and community-based support, students and families have behavioral health and non-academic needs met. 7,000+ unique students across 7 schools have been screened through the program, and over 4,500 behavioral health services and 93,000 units of social services have been delivered.

I have never been to a school that has developed such a culture of care, responsibility, and support for students that El Cerrito High has as a result of having its SBHC, The James Morehouse Project . I’ve seen school serve as a major lifeline for students who have no social support, who don’t have a trusted adult to share their experiences, to process trauma, and gather the resources and support that they need to make it through the school day, the year, and the rest of their lives. I met a number of students supported by the SBHC since they started high school who were unable to get the support offered through other venues that they received at the SBHC. These students have been able to transform themselves and ground themselves in their own values, their own truth, and their own terms in ways I have not seen at other schools. Even during the pandemic, I was able to maintain connections and support students as we experienced the collective trauma of quarantine and shelter in place and being removed from what often can be for many students one of the few safe spaces that they have in their day. Serving with just a phone call, an email, a text message, or video call was appreciated by the students I worked with who often had a hard time managing the different challenges that arose at home and that became more prevalent during the quarantine. Months into shelter in place and distance learning, we see that school-based health centers serve a vital role to continue to support students, families, and communities as we continue to face together the different challenges arising on a national level. <h3>Programs During the Pandemic Included</h3> Shared by Gilbert Gammad, MSW Candidate, UC Berkeley Counseling Intern at The James Morehouse Project SBHC, El Cerrito High School, Spring 2020", "modified": "2025-08-15T02:49:31", "slug": "a-lifeline-to-students-during-the-pandemic", "status": "publish", "excerpt": "The impact of having a school-based health center (SBHC) that provides counseling services, health services, and a space for young folks to engage in wellness is one that I personally would have loved to experience as a young person.

This year’s conference took place in Ontario at the Inland Empire Health Plan (IEHP) headquarters, with the theme of Empowering Youth Driven Waves of Change . Students led and participated in workshops and activities based around topics such as substance use prevention, peer mentoring, improving community health, and helping youth develop leadership skills. There were 11 youth-led workshops targeting topics such as fostering healthy relationships, youth advocacy, and school wellness centers. Alongside the workshops were creative and fun youth-led activities such as “get to know each other Bingo” and group activities such as guessing objects depicted in close-up photos. Students enjoyed a photobooth as well as numerous “brain breaks” that fostered a fun and creative outlet for youth to relax and bond. These youth-only rooms included bouquet-making, collaging, bracelet-making, and many more opportunities for the attendees to connect with one another and try new things. The conference cultivated a space where young people could come together to connect with one another in a youth-centered space.

The health center was founded in 1971 by a group of students at the University of California, Berkeley, as a community-based clinic to address the lack of high-quality and consistent healthcare for low-income residents in the East Bay. La Clínica has been a pioneer in its approach to training providers to administer Naloxone – a medicine that rapidly reverses an opioid overdoses in as little as 2-3 minutes – in SBHCs. The Naloxone distribution programs started out of a concern from an employee who noticed the hyper-prevalent use of narcotics in the community, often being found in colorful, attractive forms to draw the attention of children. Karen Gersten-Rothenberg, an associate medical director at La Clínica de la Raza, said SBHCs should focus on how opioids are distributed in the community when coming up with a strategy for addressing opioid use. A common strategy is a drug exchange where the community can safely dispose of excess prescription or recreational substances in a safe, hygienic center. These centers could also be an opportune setting to distribute naloxone and answer questions about the use of naloxone. Another strategy is an education program, where peer-health educators come to classrooms and explain to students what naloxone is and where they can access it. Gersten-Rothenberg underscores the importance of using the harm-reduction model to give students the autonomy to make their own decisions about their health, while providing them the resources to be safe in the case of a medical emergency. <h3>Addressing Concerns</h3> SBHCs may encounter concerns from the community, school board, or other entities. Focusing on community problems is an important strategy to explain to community members that the role of naloxone distribution is not to encourage opioid use, but rather to prevent emergencies from occurring due to misuse. Another long-term goal of some public health entities is to educate pharmacists about naloxone and change the standard of care to require naloxone prescription with a standard opioid prescription. Normalizing naloxone in the pharmaceutical setting, may influence opinions in the general public and lead to normalization in SBHC settings. <h3>Support for Schools & SBHCs</h3> The Naloxone Distribution Project (NDP) was created by the California Department of Health Care Services and provides free naloxone to registered entities including schools, universities, and community organizations. Some steps to take include: <h3>Using Naloxone</h3> Telltale signs of an opioid overdose include: When in doubt, it is usually best to administer Naloxone as this medication has no effects on a person not in overdose. In a person undergoing an opioid overdose, naloxone administration temporarily blocks opioid receptors and causes immediate relief. Side effects such as body aches, increased blood pressure, fever, etc., and professional medical help should be sought. Rescue breathing may be performed if possible. The person should also be watched until professional medical help is available.

Youth learned about nicotine addiction, e-cigarette ingredients, and the harmful health effects of smoking and vaping from the Stanford University Tobacco Prevention Toolkit and then created projects to share their knowledge schoolwide. Student Advisory Boards (SAB) at eight LAUSD high schools conducted a joint in-person and social media campaign to mark World No Tobacco Day to educate students on: Youth leaders reached additional youth through interactive social media polls that educated them on the concept of addiction and the chemicals inside JUUL pods. In-person events held at schools urged students to commit to stop smoking and vaping or to pledge to never start.

The breakfasts themselves have evolved to include more fruit and whole grains. And, working closely with the cafeteria manager, who is a strong advocate for children’s nutrition, parents have the opportunity to give input into the breakfast menus, improving appeal and quality. Lunch choices have also gotten tastier. Students advocated for improvements to the school’s salad bar, which resulted in parent volunteers from the Family Resource Center preparing the salad bar each morning to make sure students get what they want. And, at honor roll celebrations, students enjoy healthy smoothies rather than ice cream sundaes.

Fremont’s Youth Wellness Advisory Board is a diverse group of students with a shared commitment to advocating for positive policy change and advancing school wellness. With encouragement from the health educator from the Tiger Clinic School-Based Health Center (SBHC), the Advisory Board was eager to improve students’ eating habits. They invited the Director of Nutrition Services for Oakland Unified School District to talk with them about possible changes to Fremont’s meal program. The Director was impressed by the Advisory Board’s enthusiasm and organization and proposed piloting a new way of serving breakfast: the Grab-N-Go Breakfast. With the Grab-N-Go Break- fast, students could pick up a bagged meal at the school gate and bring it to class, increasing participation in the program, bringing in more federal funding, and ultimately improving food quality. Over several months, the Advisory Board, with the support of the SBHC, the School Wellness Committee, and the school’s cafeteria staff, advocated for Grab-N-Go with administrators and teachers. They had one-on-one conversations. They created presentations, using data from the statewide Breakfast First coalition. They attended staff meetings to make their case. Some adults were immediately receptive, while others needed convincing. Ultimately, though, everyone agreed to a trial run. Today, Grab-N-Go Breakfast is well-established and increasingly well-used. Many more Fremont students are eating breakfast – sometimes it’s a bagel, sometimes granola, sometimes another entrée, as well as juice and, if they want it, milk. (The Advisory Board gave feedback on the menu, even taste-testing the meals.) The system is efficient and simple: as students walk onto campus, they pick up a meal and bring it to class. Meanwhile, a cafeteria worker makes a tally mark for another well-fed student!", "modified": "2025-08-07T17:13:03", "slug": "innovative-eating-with-grab-n-go-breakfasts-fremont-high-school", "status": "publish", "excerpt": "Fremont High School began offering a free, hot breakfast to any student who showed up to the cafeteria between 7:45 a.m. and 8:10 a.m. Unfortunately, few students arrived at school early enough to eat.

Kerman Unified opened a school-based health center (SBHC) in 2013 to serve all students at the eight schools in the district. It is operated by Valley Health Team, a local Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). Robert Frausto, the Superintendent of Kerman Unified, said he chose the site for the SBHC strategically because the school campus is located within walking distance for all students in the district. The SBHC is staffed by a full-time physician, behavioral health clinicians, and two medical assistants. It has three exam rooms for primary care services. Providers see students and community members for well-child visits, sports physicals, hearing and vision screenings, sick visits, and behavioral health, among many other services. Students have a separate entrance to the clinic and the SBHC partners with the school nurse to care for students injured while at school. Watch a video tour of the SBHC. The behavioral health clinic provides mental health care for students – ranging from serious concerns about trauma to just needing someone to talk to. Primary care and behavioral health are integrated and the team collaborates daily to provide optimal care to patients. In 2020, the clinic began offering drive-through COVID testing to members of the community. COVID vaccinations are also being offered at the site. “A few weeks back my daughter who attends Kerman Middle had a rapid heart rate. I brought her to a Valley Health Team clinic. The school site now has all the information so if anything should arise in the future, she can get care right away.” – parent of a Kerman Unified student Superintendent Frausto credits the SBHC with Kerman Unified’s award-winning attendance record because it cuts down on absences that many times are caused by students missing a full day of school because of a doctor’s appointment. Those visits are now much more efficient because students do not have to leave campus. Superintendent Frausto says his district’s solid partnership with Valley Health Team is key to the success of the SBHC in meeting the needs of the students and the community. He recalls one year when 30 kindergarten students all needed vaccinations or they would not be able to start school. He called up Valley Health Team and the immunizations were handled at the SBHC in short order. Valley Health Team CEO Soyla Griffin says her FQHC’s mission is to do whatever it takes to keep children in the community healthy, and the SBHC is a great way to achieve that goal. Parents also credit the SBHC with providing them with a sense of security. “A few weeks back my daughter who attends Kerman Middle had a rapid heart rate. I brought her to a Valley Health Team clinic. The school site now has all the information so if anything should arise in the future, she can get care right away,” said a parent of a Kerman Unified student. <h2>Stay Up-to-Date on School-Based Health</h2> Sign up to receive our free newsletter and advocate for kids’ health.
