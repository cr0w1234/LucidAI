Rehma, as a Youth Board member, aims to utilize her leadership skills to advocate as a youth leader in her community and work towards creating a safe and welcoming environment where teens can share their experiences. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, Rehma discovered her passion for public health through her work and internships with various organizations. At school, she worked with Discovering the Realities of Our Community, an organization focused on transforming the community and promoting environmental prevention of alcohol and drug abuse. Rehma engaged with her state representatives on these matters, managed inventories, implemented improvement strategies, facilitated meetings, learned about local policies, generated monthly reports, and built meaningful relationships. She was involved with the CourAGE (Advocacy Generation Education) program for four years, where she educated the public about the harmful effects of alcohol, tobacco, and other substances by organizing workshops and participating in a countywide conference with youth-led workshops on substance misuse. She also developed advocacy projects and implemented improvement plans while building relationships to motivate others to make healthier choices. Rehma felt empowered to hear youth voices and found it meaningful to hear younger youths wanting to amplify their voice and be a positive influence on their peers.</p>\n",

Nancy has worked on multiple public service announcements and campaigns that highlight prevention efforts for underage drinking, smoking, substance use, and gambling. Being a part of the HOPE youth coalition, a statewide YLI program, she participated in advocacy efforts to address the harmful presence of alcohol and substance advertisements on social media. Her art can be seen published in multiple zine and publication art covers for YLI. Nancy also had the opportunity to participate at the Mental Health Matters Day press conference at the California State Capital, where she presented the impacts of social media on youth’s mental health and provided recommendations to address these issues alongside State Assembly member Buffy Wicks, and California’s First Lady Jennifer Siebel Newsome. Nancy hopes to continue pursuing her passion for both art and advocating for youth’s mental health.</p>\n",

Jubilee is on an accelerated pathway to graduation, where she is projected to graduate in three years with a Bachelor of Science in Global and Community Health. Jubilee volunteers her time with Planned Parenthood Mar Monte as a patient escort and volunteer ambassador, and also works for UC Santa Cruz as a part of the Student Health Outreach and Promotion team. Jubilee is also currently in progress to become EMT-B certified. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her passion for youth engagement, specifically concerning health, stems from her personal experiences with school-based health centers as a young person. Jubilee is incredibly passionate about eliminating systemic barriers to good health and hopes to incorporate her knowledge of public health into her career as a healthcare provider. After graduation this spring, Jubilee hopes to work as an EMT and eventually attend Physician Assistant (PA) school as she continues her education beyond her undergraduate studies. In her free time, Jubilee enjoys running and training for races, hiking, biking, camping, spending time outside, and cooking. <a href=\"https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_7806-1.jpg\"></a></p>\n",

After receiving her Bachelor’s degree, she plans to continue pursuing an education and career in medicine. Dina stumbled upon her passion for public health throughout the years as a result of working with and interning for groups such as the Los Angeles Trust for Children’s Health as a Policy Intern. She has also worked with other groups such as Diversify Our Narrative and the Miles Hall Foundation, which aim to create an inclusive, intersectional, and equitable environment within K-12 schools. She is also a dedicated member of her university’s Associated Students Program Board, University Blood Initiative, and the Iranian Student Association. In her free time, she volunteers at a free clinic or in the cardiovascular unit at Riverside Community Hospital. It is within these groups that she is reminded of the drive that pushes her to continue studying medicine. Dina’s advocacy efforts are driven by her own Treacher Collins Syndrome and unyielding belief that adequate health care is a human right and must be accessible for all.</p>\n",
