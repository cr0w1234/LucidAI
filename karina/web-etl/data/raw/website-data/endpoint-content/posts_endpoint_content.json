These students have been able to transform themselves and ground themselves in their own values, their own truth, and their own terms in ways I have not seen at other schools.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Even during the pandemic, I was able to maintain connections and support students as we experienced the collective trauma of quarantine and shelter in place and being removed from what often can be for many students one of the few safe spaces that they have in their day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Serving with just a phone call, an email, a text message, or video call was appreciated by the students I worked with who often had a hard time managing the different challenges that arose at home and that became more prevalent during the quarantine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Months into shelter in place and distance learning, we see that school-based health centers serve a vital role to continue to support students, families, and communities as we continue to face together the different challenges arising on a national level.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Programs During the Pandemic Included</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Individual counseling and crisis intervention/support, therapeutic groups (e.g. grief, social skills, BIPOC young women’s group)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Youth development (e.g. Youth ELAC–for English language learners, Skittles for queer identified BIPOC youth, Bate Popo–for Portuguese speakers)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Case management for young people and their families – including by supporting students/families to navigate and problem solve around the demands of distance learning and to access cash support, legal aid, food, and other resources for families facing financial crisis</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Individual and group support for teachers</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Playing a leadership role in a year-long professional development series for faculty and staff around race and equity</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br><em>Shared by Gilbert Gammad, MSW Candidate, UC Berkeley</em><br><em>Counseling Intern at The James Morehouse Project SBHC, El Cerrito High School, Spring 2020</em></p>\n",

Alongside the workshops were creative and fun youth-led activities such as “get to know each other Bingo” and group activities such as guessing objects depicted in close-up photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students enjoyed a photobooth as well as numerous “brain breaks” that fostered a fun and creative outlet for youth to relax and bond. These youth-only rooms included bouquet-making, collaging, bracelet-making, and many more opportunities for the attendees to connect with one another and try new things.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"710\" src=\"https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Y2Y-2024-Students-Presenting-Substance-Use.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3347\" style=\"width:448px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Y2Y-2024-Students-Presenting-Substance-Use.jpg 1024w, https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Y2Y-2024-Students-Presenting-Substance-Use-300x208.jpg 300w, https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Y2Y-2024-Students-Presenting-Substance-Use-768x533.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Students present to other students about different substances and how they affect health and behavior during a workshop session.

The health center was founded in 1971 by a group of students at the University of California, Berkeley, as a community-based clinic to address the lack of high-quality and consistent healthcare for low-income residents in the East Bay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La Clínica has been a pioneer in its approach to training providers to administer&nbsp;<a href=\"/resource/substance-use/naloxone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Naloxone</a>&nbsp;– a medicine that rapidly reverses an opioid overdoses in as little as 2-3 minutes – in SBHCs. The Naloxone distribution programs started out of a concern from an employee who noticed the hyper-prevalent use of narcotics in the community, often being found in colorful, attractive forms to draw the attention of children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karen Gersten-Rothenberg, an associate medical director at La Clínica de la Raza, said SBHCs should focus on how opioids are distributed in the community when coming up with a strategy for addressing opioid use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A common strategy is a drug exchange where the community can safely dispose of excess prescription or recreational substances in a safe, hygienic center. These centers could also be an opportune setting to distribute naloxone and answer questions about the use of naloxone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another strategy is an education program, where peer-health educators come to classrooms and explain to students what naloxone is and where they can access it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gersten-Rothenberg underscores the importance of using the harm-reduction model to give students the autonomy to make their own decisions about their health, while providing them the resources to be safe in the case of a medical emergency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Addressing Concerns</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"873\" src=\"https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Naloxone-SBHC-Storage.jpg\" alt=\"A storage cabinet at a school-based health center shows Narcan being stored on a shelf.\" class=\"wp-image-2944\" style=\"width:275px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Naloxone-SBHC-Storage.jpg 768w, https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Naloxone-SBHC-Storage-264x300.jpg 264w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>SBHCs may encounter concerns from the community, school board, or other entities. Focusing on community problems is an important strategy to explain to community members that the role of naloxone distribution is not to encourage opioid use, but rather to prevent emergencies from occurring due to misuse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another long-term goal of some public health entities is to educate pharmacists about naloxone and change the standard of care to require naloxone prescription with a standard opioid prescription.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Normalizing naloxone in the pharmaceutical setting, may influence opinions in the general public and lead to normalization in SBHC settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Support for Schools &amp; SBHCs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/individuals/Pages/Naloxone_Distribution_Project.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Naloxone Distribution Project (NDP)</a>&nbsp;was created by the California Department of Health Care Services and provides free naloxone to registered entities including schools, universities, and community organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some steps to take include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Complete an application for the Naloxone Distribution Project (NDP)\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Ask for basic demographic information</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Obtain a Naloxone standing order or physician prescription</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Licensure Information (FEIN Number, Nonprofit status, etc)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Develop a Distribution Plan</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once naloxone is received, complete overdose reversal forms and submit to NDP</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Using Naloxone</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Telltale signs of an opioid overdose include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>an unresponsive person</li>\n\n\n\n<li>shallow and/or difficult breathing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>a person who is going in and out of consciousness</li>\n\n\n\n<li>a black circle in the pupils.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"339\" height=\"494\" src=\"https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Naloxone-Kit-Sample.jpg\" alt=\"A sample opioid overdose kit shows Naloxone cartridges and information on what to do during an overdose.\" class=\"wp-image-2945\" style=\"width:218px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Naloxone-Kit-Sample.jpg 339w, https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Naloxone-Kit-Sample-206x300.jpg 206w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 339px) 100vw, 339px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When in doubt, it is usually best to administer Naloxone as this medication has no effects on a person not in overdose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a person undergoing an opioid overdose, naloxone administration temporarily blocks opioid receptors and causes immediate relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Side effects such as body aches, increased blood pressure, fever, etc., and professional medical help should be sought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rescue breathing may be performed if possible.

The school-based health center&#8217;s (SBHC) leaders are focusing on primary prevention to complement the much-needed medical care. New efforts to promote healthy eating are bringing many stakeholders – including students, parents, community members, and others – together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The school garden has been a huge success, providing students with experiential environmental and nutrition education. Groups of students, including the boys’ basket- ball team, tend the garden from planting to harvesting – and then eat their results. For many, the garden provides an opportunity for a new, deeply engaging and rewarding school experience. This experience has also influence families’ food choices and habits, with students prompting new meal and snack ideas. Recently, OBUGS, which coordinates the garden program, merged with LifeLong Medical Care (the SBHC’s lead agency) creating an even stronger partnership for health and facilitating better integration between clinical and non-clinical care, between prevention and treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, WOMS families are engaging in a community-based, community-driven series of cooking classes. Organized jointly by SBHC leaders and other neighborhood groups, the classes include an introductory eight-week series as well as specific classes focused on particular health issues. Every session, attendance grows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the SBHC facilitates a weekly back pack food program in collaboration with Alameda County that serves 50 WOMS families to help improve their healthy eating habits.</p>\n",

The health educator from the Hawthorne Clinic and the school nurse co-lead a “crew,” giving them the opportunity to engage directly with a small group of students. The breakfasts themselves have evolved to include more fruit and whole grains. And, working closely with the cafeteria manager, who is a strong advocate for children’s nutrition, parents have the opportunity to give input into the breakfast menus, improving appeal and quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lunch choices have also gotten tastier. Students advocated for improvements to the school’s salad bar, which resulted in parent volunteers from the Family Resource Center preparing the salad bar each morning to make sure students get what they want. And, at honor roll celebrations, students enjoy healthy smoothies rather than ice cream sundaes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With leadership from the Wellness Champions and Physical Education teacher, UPA started growing its own food on campus. The Family Resource Center engages students and families in regular gardening programs and in deciding what to grow. Volunteers range from early morning helpers who plant, weed, water, and harvest, as well a more intensive gardening during the summer. The space draws in the entire UPA community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, UPA is working to improve food choices not just on campus but also in homes. The school collaborates with the Alameda County Food Bank to deliver food to families and the Family Resource Center has convinced local fruit stands to donate to UPA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

With encouragement from the health educator from the Tiger Clinic School-Based Health Center (SBHC), the Advisory Board was eager to improve students’ eating habits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They invited the Director of Nutrition Services for Oakland Unified School District to talk with them about possible changes to Fremont’s meal program. The Director was impressed by the Advisory Board’s enthusiasm and organization and proposed piloting a new way of serving breakfast: the Grab-N-Go Breakfast. With the Grab-N-Go Break- fast, students could pick up a bagged meal at the school gate and bring it to class, increasing participation in the program, bringing in more federal funding, and ultimately improving food quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over several months, the Advisory Board, with the support of the SBHC, the School Wellness Committee, and the school’s cafeteria staff, advocated for Grab-N-Go with administrators and teachers. They had one-on-one conversations. They created presentations, using data from the statewide Breakfast First coalition. They attended staff meetings to make their case. Some adults were immediately receptive, while others needed convincing. Ultimately, though, everyone agreed to a trial run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Grab-N-Go Breakfast is well-established and increasingly well-used. Many more Fremont students are eating breakfast – sometimes it’s a bagel, sometimes granola, sometimes another entrée, as well as juice and, if they want it, milk. (The Advisory Board gave feedback on the menu, even taste-testing the meals.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system is efficient and simple: as students walk onto campus, they pick up a meal and bring it to class. Meanwhile, a cafeteria worker makes a tally mark for another well-fed student!</p>\n",

Kerman Unified opened a school-based health center (SBHC) in 2013 to serve all students at the eight schools in the district. It is operated by Valley Health Team, a local Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Kerman-USD-SBHC-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Entrance to the Kerman School-Based Health Center with an accessible ramp and red railings leading to the red front door.\" class=\"wp-image-16022\" style=\"width:331px;height:auto\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert Frausto, the Superintendent of Kerman Unified, said he chose the site for the SBHC strategically because the school campus is located within walking distance for all students in the district.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SBHC is staffed by a full-time physician, behavioral health clinicians, and two medical assistants. It has three exam rooms for primary care services. Providers see students and community members for well-child visits, sports physicals, hearing and vision screenings, sick visits, and behavioral health, among many other services. Students have a separate entrance to the clinic and the SBHC partners with the school nurse to care for students injured while at school.&nbsp;<strong>Watch a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/kgSRzJuqSiE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">video tour</a>&nbsp;of the SBHC.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Kerman Unified Valley Community Health Center Virtual Tour\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgSRzJuqSiE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The behavioral health clinic provides mental health care for students – ranging from serious concerns about trauma to just needing someone to talk to. Primary care and behavioral health are integrated and the team collaborates daily to provide optimal care to patients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, the clinic began offering drive-through COVID testing to members of the community. COVID vaccinations are also being offered at the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"block_2a8b5976fb056f77d53e3ab1762850e1\"\n     class=\"custom-quote-block orientation-horizontal \">\n    \n    <div class=\"block-quote__inner has-sunshine-yellow-background-color\" style=\" padding-top: 24px; padding-bottom: 24px; --triangle-color: var(--wp--preset--color--sunshine-yellow);\">\n    <div class=\"quote-icon\">\n        <svg width=\"29\" height=\"40\" viewBox=\"0 0 47 42\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n            <path d=\"M46.3584 0.819052V8.62705C44.4878 8.78972 42.7798 9.52172 41.2344 10.8231C39.7704 12.1244 38.5911 13.7917 37.6964 15.8251C36.8831 17.7771 36.4764 19.9324 36.4764 22.2911H45.9924V41.0791H26.5944V24.3651C26.5944 19.2411 27.4891 15.0117 29.2784 11.6771C31.1491 8.34238 33.5891 5.78038 36.5984 3.99106C39.6078 2.20172 42.8611 1.14439 46.3584 0.819052ZM19.8844 0.819052V8.62705C18.0138 8.78972 16.3058 9.52172 14.7604 10.8231C13.2964 12.1244 12.1171 13.7917 11.2224 15.8251C10.4091 17.7771 10.0024 19.9324 10.0024 22.2911H19.3964V41.0791H-0.00156685V24.3651C-0.00156685 19.2411 0.933766 15.0117 2.80443 11.6771C4.6751 8.34238 7.1151 5.78038 10.1244 3.99106C13.1338 2.20172 16.3871 1.14439 19.8844 0.819052Z\" fill=\"#6B397C\"/>\n        </svg>\n    </div>\n        \n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group group-quote is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>“A few weeks back my daughter who attends Kerman Middle had a rapid heart rate.

Those visits are now much more efficient because students do not have to leave campus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Superintendent Frausto says his district’s solid partnership with Valley Health Team is key to the success of the SBHC in meeting the needs of the students and the community. He recalls one year when 30 kindergarten students all needed vaccinations or they would not be able to start school. He called up Valley Health Team and the immunizations were handled at the SBHC in short order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Valley Health Team CEO Soyla Griffin says her FQHC’s mission is to do whatever it takes to keep children in the community healthy, and the SBHC is a great way to achieve that goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parents also credit the SBHC with providing them with a sense of security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A few weeks back my daughter who attends Kerman Middle had a rapid heart rate.
