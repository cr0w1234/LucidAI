This reversal removes a major barrier for schools to obtain federal Medicaid funding for student health services and creates an opportunity for schools to expand the role they play in improving the health of low-income students. The change in federal policy could open the door for schools to reimagine their role in the health care delivery system and augment their efforts on behalf of children.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CMS Approves California SPA 15-021</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In April 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved California’s State Plan Amendment (SPA) 15-021. This brings to a close the state’s five-year process to expand coverage of health services to all Medicaid enrolled students, per the change to the “free care rule.” SPA 15-021 expands access to Federal Medicaid funds for LEAs, through the following three primary changes: (1) incorporating Random Moment Time Survey (RMTS) into the cost settlement process, (2) adding new service practitioners and new services covered under the LEA BOP, and (3) expanding the population covered under the LEA BOP to include Medicaid beneficiaries outside of special education to those covered by an Individualized Health and Support Plan (IHSP) also known as a “Care Plan”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Resources for Schools</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>CDE and DHCS Collaboration Letter: <a href=\"https://dev-chsatransfer.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LEA-BOP-DHCS-CDE-Collaboration-Letter-6.30.2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">State Plan Amendment 15-021</a> (June 2020)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>DHCS factsheets\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://dev-chsatransfer.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/LEA-PROGRAM-OVERVIEW.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Overview of LEA Billing Option Program</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://dev-chsatransfer.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/LEA-BOP-SPA-15-021-OVERVIEW.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Overview of State Plan Amendment 15-021</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://dev-chsatransfer.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/LEA-BOP-FREE-CARE-OVERVIEW.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Overview of Free Care</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Brief: <a href=\"https://dev-chsatransfer.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017-Enhancing-Services-for-Students-California-LEAs.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Enhancing Services for Students: California Local Education Agency Medi-Cal Reinvestments</a><br>To participate in the Medi-Cal Billing Option Program, Local Education Agencies (LEAs) are required to reinvest the federal reimbursement received into services that support students and their families.

They are typically staffed by nurse practitioners, nurses, mental health providers, as well as part-time physicians and medical students. Services are provided at no or low cost. No one is refused service for inability to pay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/locations/\">SBHCs/WCs across California</a>&nbsp;provide elementary, middle, and high school students with easy access to health care. Many SBHCs/WCs also offer dental care, mental health care, leadership programs, after-school programs, and even have gardens for growing fresh produce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here you can see what is happening at California’s SBHCs/WCs.

AJR 10 affirms the Legislature’s support for the federal school-based health center program authorized by Congress in 2010 and calls for an appropriation by Congress for that program. It also affirms the Legislature’s support for state and federal policies that include school-based health centers as partners for creating medical homes for all children, and for the inclusion of school-based health centers in the reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act as an important strategy for ensuring that students are physically and mentally healthy and therefore ready to learn.

Schwarzenegger in September 2008, SB 564 builds upon an earlier Ridley-Thomas bill, AB 2560, which established a Public School Health Center Support Program. SB 564 created a grant program for school health centers administered by the Public School Health Center Support Program. To date, the grant program has not been funded.

Schwarzenegger on Sept. 19, 2006, this law created a Public School Health Center Program jointly administered by the Department of Health Services and the Department of Education. The program was designed to collect school health center data, facilitate the development of comprehensive health centers in partnership with California public schools, and address the programmatic, clinical, finance, and policy needs of California’s school health centers. To date, the program has not been implemented because neither state funding nor staff was made available for the program.

Healthy Start programs offer: academic and educational support; youth development and employment services; family support services; and medical and mental health care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of California’s SBHCs started as Healthy Start programs.&nbsp;Healthy Start funding peaked at $39 million in the 1990s. In 2007, the program was funded at $10 million. Since 2007, no new Healthy Start grants have been awarded.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Federal Laws Regarding School-Based Health Centers</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (aka Health Care Reform) (2010)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Public Law 111-148, Title IV, Subtitle B, Sec 4101</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This piece of legislation defines school-based health centers as providing comprehensive primary care services, including both physical and mental health services, at or near a school, in a clinic operated by a qualified sponsoring agency.

School-based health centers (SBHCs), defined as health clinics located on or near school campuses where children and youth can get immediate help for acute and chronic conditions as well as preventative care, are positioned to help create more equitable access to care for youth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interest and momentum are building among local stakeholders in the Inland Empire region of California (Riverside and San Bernardino Counties) to develop new school-based health and wellness centers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The California School-Based Health Alliance’s&nbsp;<a href=\"/resources/student-health-index/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Student Health Index</a>&nbsp;— designed to identify opportunities to expand health care in schools — revealed that San Bernardino County has five of the top ten school districts with the highest ratio of high need schools to total schools.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Purpose</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of the Inland Empire School-Based Health Centers Coalition (coalition) is to expand and support the SBHC movement, and to facilitate greater engagement, investment, and proliferation of school health services, all of which equate to greater access for youth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Goals</h5>\n\n\n   \r\n\r\n<script>\r\n\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div

From cities to rural towns, people are coming together to advocate for school-based health centers (SBHC) and wellness centers (WC) and actively pursuing local, state, federal, and philanthropic support to start, enhance, and sustain these vital health services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Progress is happening — but we’re just getting started. Thousands more children, youth, and families still need access to the life-changing care that SBHCs/WCs provide. The <strong>California School-Based Health Alliance</strong> (CSHA) is leading the charge and shaping the policy landscape to expand comprehensive school health services across the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every year, we zero in on bold policy priorities and take strong stands on key legislation — all with one mission in mind: <strong>to ensure every student has the support, care, and resources they need to be healthy, safe, ready to learn and thrive.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group jump-menu--wrapper is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns jump-menu--columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\"><section class=\"jump-menu-block\">\n    <nav class=\"jump-menu\" aria-label=\"Jump Menu Navigation\">\n        <div class=\"jump-menu--label\">\n            Overview        </div>\n        <ul class=\"jump-menu__list\">\n            <!-- Populated via JS -->\n        </ul>\n    </nav>\n</section>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%\"> \n<section id=\"block-6952ec8cd9135\"\n         class=\"jump-item\"\n                      data-nav-title=\"Policy Priorities\"\n         >\n    \n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Policy Priorities</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Goal 1 </strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advocate for state funding</strong>&nbsp;to start, improve, and expand new school-based health centers and wellness centers (SBHCs/WCs).</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Goal 2</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ensure students’ access to physical, mental, sexual + reproductive health</strong>&nbsp;by protecting access to medically accurate, confidential, culturally relevant, and age-appropriate health services in schools.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Goal 3</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Champion school environments that support whole child well-being</strong>&nbsp;so students can thrive.</p>\n\n</section>\n\n\n \n<section id=\"block-6952ec8cd92de\"\n         class=\"jump-item\"\n         >\n    \n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Advocacy Platform</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As part of its advocacy mission, the California School-Based Health Alliance (CSHA) often takes public positions on bills, ballot initiatives, and public policy issues that other organizations are sponsoring.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognizing that improving the health and academic success of children and youth is impacted by many factors, systems, and policies and to further the mission of advancing health services in schools, CSHA supports legislation and policies that:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Increase access and resources for school-based health and wellness services, including but not limited to school-based and school-linked health centers, wellness centers, schoolwide screenings, behavioral health services, and dental and vision services.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ensure students have access to healthy school environments including but not limited to policies advancing healthy food, health education, physical activity, school climate, school staff wellness, whole child/whole youth approaches, and safe facilities.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Transform a health care delivery system in a direction that allows for multiple access points, integrated care, broader preventive care, reduced disparities, and improved outcomes for children and youth.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Promote expanded opportunities for youth advocacy, leadership, and engagement within education and healthcare settings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Increase state revenue for children’s health and education.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Preserve and expand access to health care coverage for children and families.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create welcoming healthcare and educational environments for immigrant children and families.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Increase access to and reduce restrictions on youth access to sexual and reproductive health services.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline by reducing punitive school discipline policies, maximizing access to restorative, trauma-informed approaches, minimizing school “push out” and eliminating police in schools.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create equitable health, human service, and education programs for youth in the foster care and juvenile justice systems, youth experiencing homelessness, unaccompanied minors, LGBTQ+ youth, trafficked youth, and youth of color.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Increase approved vaccinations among students, staff, and school-based health providers to ensure our communities are protected against preventable diseases, especially for those students and families most vulnerable.
