On campuses with SBHCs, about 70% of students receive free or reduced price meals. Students in communities that benefit from school-based health and wellness centers are less likely to have health insurance or access to health and mental health services that address these risk factors. Without access to high-quality health services, childhood risk factors are more likely to be translated into higher rates of diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and other chronic illnesses in adulthood as well as more struggles with academic success. Of California’s 400 school-based health and wellness centers: Most of California’s SBHCs are physically located right on campus within a main building or in a portable. In some areas, health services are provided by mobile medical or dental vans, and in other areas, “school-linked” health centers are off campus and have formal operating agreements with schools. School-based health centers and wellness centers (SBHCs/WCs) are spread from Del Norte to San Diego County with large concentrations in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area.

School-based health centers (SBHCs), defined as health clinics located on or near school campuses where children and youth can get immediate help for acute and chronic conditions as well as preventative care, are positioned to help create more equitable access to care for youth. Interest and momentum are building among local stakeholders in the Inland Empire region of California (Riverside and San Bernardino Counties) to develop new school-based health and wellness centers. The California School-Based Health Alliance’s Student Health Index — designed to identify opportunities to expand health care in schools — revealed that San Bernardino County has five of the top ten school districts with the highest ratio of high need schools to total schools. <h5>Purpose</h5> The purpose of the Inland Empire School-Based Health Centers Coalition (coalition) is to expand and support the SBHC movement, and to facilitate greater engagement, investment, and proliferation of school health services, all of which equate to greater access for youth. <h5>Goals</h5> <h3>Develop Partnerships</h3> <h3>Leverage Support</h3> <h3>Technical Assistance</h3> <h2>Steering Committee</h2> The development and maintenance of the coalition is supported by the California School-Based Health Alliance. We do this in partnership with representatives from partner health, education, and community based agencies from throughout the region. The steering committee provides leadership and guidance around the development and operations of the coalition, which includes planning convenings and serving as a channel of communication about school-based health care. <h6>School-Based Health Center Webinar Series</h6> The California School-Based Health Alliance has partnered with the San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools to present a series of webinars on bringing school-based health and wellness centers to schools. <h6>The School Health Connection Podcast</h6> The School Health Connection Podcast is your go-to source for insights and inspiration in creating healthier school environments. Brought to you by the California School-Based Health Alliance, Inland Empire School Health Coalition, and in collaboration with the San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools. <h6>Resources from Our 2024 Fall Inland Empire School-Based Health Symposium</h6> <h6>Symposium Keynote Speaker</h6> Yesenia Ceballos , M.A., APCC, PPS, has dedicated over two decades to the field of education, with extensive experience as both a teacher and school counselor in diverse school settings. She currently serves as the Wellness Counselor at Sierra High School (SHS) in San Bernardino, where her leadership has played a key role in the school being named one of America’s Healthiest Schools for two consecutive years and a member of the Recognized ASCA Model Program (RAMP) team. Driven by her personal journey, Yesenia is passionate about advocating for historically underserved youth, working as a catalyst for change. She partners with community-based organizations to provide students with access to evidence-based therapies and physical health services and has established a resource center that is open to the entire community. <h3>Developing & Implementing Universal Screening Efforts at a Wellness Center</h3> Schools are a critical provider of services to address the socio-emotional, behavioral health, and basic needs of students. Universal screening offers one avenue for systematically evaluating, identifying, and monitoring the needs of an entire student population. Acknowledging the reality of limited school-based resources for supporting ongoing screening efforts, this workshop will review the development and beta implementation of a novel digital system that enables identification of at-risk students via the administration of brief, psychometrically valid measures; expedited identification and referral to relevant services via automatic scoring and filtering; as well as ongoing progress tracking at individual and school-wide levels. Presenter: Shayna Greenberg , MA, PhD Student, Loma Linda University <h3>What Drives Student Health: Integrating Social Drivers of Health & Equity</h3> This workshop explores the impact of social drivers of health (SDOH) on student well-being and academic achievement, framed within the Whole Child, Whole School, Whole Community (WSCC) model. Participants will gain insights into how SDOH affects student well-being and academic success. The session will highlight the importance of integrating equity and justice into these discussions, emphasizing the establishment of student health centers as a key strategy. Presenter: Brianna Vasquez , MPH, CHES, Health Education Specialist II, San Bernardino County Department of Public Health <h3>Riverside County Office of Education’s CAREspace</h3> RCOE CAREspace provides free mental health and related services to students, families, staff, schools, and the community of Riverside County.

This has been a growing concern across California, leading to adverse child outcomes. To help address these needs, California Health and Human Services has made an unprecedented $4.7 billion investment to reimagine integrated ecosystems called the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative (CYBHI). In this presentation, you will hear how the CYBHI workstreams are supporting opportunities to improve outcomes for children. Presenter: Michael Lombardo , MA, Public Administration and Policy Advisor for Human Services and Education Agencies, MCL Collaboration <h3>Creative Financing & Sustainability of School-Based Wellness Centers</h3> This workshop will provide a model for integrated behavioral health services operated through middle or high school Wellness Centers.  Participants will walk away with a Wellness Center guide providing a clear system for accessing services which are reimbursable and integrated within the school.  Services include Coordination of Services Team Meetings, peer services, mentoring, outreach, case management, behavioral health direct services, group services, and other means of correction. Presenter: Jose Campos , MEd, MEd Admin, Director, Jurupa Unified School District <h3>IEHP Healthy School Program</h3> In collaboration with Local Education Agencies (LEAs), aligning with the statewide initiative – the Student Behavioral Health Incentive Program (SBHIP) and IEHP’s Health Navigator (HN) Program – we seek to provide targeted services and supports to identified students and their families. The Program empowers IEHP Members to easily access preventive services and receive care for their chronic conditions (i.e., Asthma, etc.). The Program promotes appropriate utilization of health care services such as: the afterhours Nurse Advice Line Urgent Care Clinics, and Primary Care Providers to ensure Members receive the care they need when they need it and at the right place and at the right time. This promotion of appropriate health care utilization will ensure students are in school ready to learn! The HN will also make sure to connect students and their families to community and Health Plan resources based on need. As a program, we intend to form strong partnerships with school staff (counselors, health aides, Principals, teachers, office personnel, etc.) to help support the students/families in need in areas of physical, mental, and social wellbeing. Presenter: Sonia Rivas , Health Navigator Program Manager, Inland Empire Health Plan <h3>Transforming Our Partnerships for Student Success: Addressing Behavioral Health and Non-Academic Needs in an Upstream and Universal Manner</h3> This workshop will share the successes and learnings from a 4-year partnership between Riverside University Health System and Hemet Unified School District. Through a system of tiered behavioral health services, universal holistic health screening, and onsite and community-based support, students and families have behavioral health and non-academic needs met. 7,000+ unique students across 7 schools have been screened through the program, and over 4,500 behavioral health services and 93,000 units of social services have been delivered. Of note, the percentage of students with concerning behavioral health needs has decreased from a baseline of 15% in 2020 to 7% in 2023.

From cities to rural towns, people are coming together to advocate for school-based health centers (SBHC) and wellness centers (WC) and actively pursuing local, state, federal, and philanthropic support to start, enhance, and sustain these vital health services. Progress is happening — but we’re just getting started. Thousands more children, youth, and families still need access to the life-changing care that SBHCs/WCs provide. The California School-Based Health Alliance (CSHA) is leading the charge and shaping the policy landscape to expand comprehensive school health services across the state. Every year, we zero in on bold policy priorities and take strong stands on key legislation — all with one mission in mind: to ensure every student has the support, care, and resources they need to be healthy, safe, ready to learn and thrive. Goal 1: Advocate for state funding to start, improve, and expand new school-based health centers and wellness centers (SBHCs/WCs). Goal 2: Ensure students’ access to physical, mental, sexual + reproductive health by protecting access to medically accurate, confidential, culturally relevant, and age-appropriate health services in schools. Goal 3: Champion school environments that support whole child well-being so students can thrive. As part of its advocacy mission, the California School-Based Health Alliance (CSHA) often takes public positions on bills, ballot initiatives, and public policy issues that other organizations are sponsoring. Recognizing that improving the health and academic success of children and youth is impacted by many factors, systems, and policies and to further the mission of advancing health services in schools, CSHA supports legislation and policies that: Stay informed. Be inspired. Join the movement. Explore the latest updates on health and education policies that are transforming school health in California — and find out how you can help power the next wave of change.",

AJR 10 affirms the Legislature’s support for the federal school-based health center program authorized by Congress in 2010 and calls for an appropriation by Congress for that program. It also affirms the Legislature’s support for state and federal policies that include school-based health centers as partners for creating medical homes for all children, and for the inclusion of school-based health centers in the reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act as an important strategy for ensuring that students are physically and mentally healthy and therefore ready to learn. Read the full text of AJR 10 (PDF). <h3>SB 564 (Ridley-Thomas): The School Health Centers Expansion Act (2008)</h3> Chapter 381, Statutes of 2008; sponsored by the California School-Based Health Alliance Signed by Gov. Schwarzenegger in September 2008, SB 564 builds upon an earlier Ridley-Thomas bill, AB 2560, which established a Public School Health Center Support Program. SB 564 created a grant program for school health centers administered by the Public School Health Center Support Program. To date, the grant program has not been funded. Read the full text of SB 564 (PDF). <h3>AB 2560 (Ridley-Thomas): The School Health Centers Act (2006)</h3> Chapter 334, Statutes of 2006; sponsored by the California School-Based Health Alliance Signed by Gov. Schwarzenegger on Sept. 19, 2006, this law created a Public School Health Center Program jointly administered by the Department of Health Services and the Department of Education. The program was designed to collect school health center data, facilitate the development of comprehensive health centers in partnership with California public schools, and address the programmatic, clinical, finance, and policy needs of California’s school health centers. To date, the program has not been implemented because neither state funding nor staff was made available for the program. Read the full text of AB 2560 (PDF). <h3>SB 620 (Presley): Healthy Start Support Services for Children Act (1991)</h3> Chapter 759, Statutes of 1991 This bill established Healthy Start, which provides planning and implementation grants for school-based student support services and their coordination. Healthy Start programs offer: academic and educational support; youth development and employment services; family support services; and medical and mental health care. Many of California’s SBHCs started as Healthy Start programs. Healthy Start funding peaked at $39 million in the 1990s. In 2007, the program was funded at $10 million. Since 2007, no new Healthy Start grants have been awarded. <h2>Federal Laws Regarding School-Based Health Centers</h2> <h3>Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (aka Health Care Reform) (2010)</h3> Public Law 111-148, Title IV, Subtitle B, Sec 4101 This piece of legislation defines school-based health centers as providing comprehensive primary care services, including both physical and mental health services, at or near a school, in a clinic operated by a qualified sponsoring agency.

It may also provide behavioral health, dental, optometry, and/or ancillary services (i.e. health education, youth engagement, case management). A wellness center (WC) means a student-focused center 1 located at or near a school that provides age-appropriate, clinical behavioral health services 2 by providers 4 . It may also provide non-medical ancillary services. The American Academy of Pediatrics considers SBHCs to be an important way for students to get access to care and—because they are mostly located in communities with a high proportion of historically disadvantaged populations—an effective way to advance health equity. 1 The center may be a facility or a mobile unit, and must include at least one confidential treatment space appropriate to services provided, as well as an additional area for reception, enrollment, and triage 2 Services may be provided in-person or via telehealth 3 As defined by HRSA 4 As defined by California Board of Behavioral Sciences <h3>A Growing Movement</h3> As the statewide nonprofit working to advance school-based health centers, our goal is to grow the number of SBHCs/WCs in California to 500 by 2030.

I have never been to a school that has developed such a culture of care, responsibility, and support for students that El Cerrito High has as a result of having its SBHC, The James Morehouse Project . I’ve seen school serve as a major lifeline for students who have no social support, who don’t have a trusted adult to share their experiences, to process trauma, and gather the resources and support that they need to make it through the school day, the year, and the rest of their lives. Photo credit: James Morehouse Project I met a number of students supported by the SBHC since they started high school who were unable to get the support offered through other venues that they received at the SBHC. These students have been able to transform themselves and ground themselves in their own values, their own truth, and their own terms in ways I have not seen at other schools. Even during the pandemic, I was able to maintain connections and support students as we experienced the collective trauma of quarantine and shelter in place and being removed from what often can be for many students one of the few safe spaces that they have in their day. Serving with just a phone call, an email, a text message, or video call was appreciated by the students I worked with who often had a hard time managing the different challenges that arose at home and that became more prevalent during the quarantine. Months into shelter in place and distance learning, we see that school-based health centers serve a vital role to continue to support students, families, and communities as we continue to face together the different challenges arising on a national level. <h3>Programs During the Pandemic Included</h3> Shared by Gilbert Gammad, MSW Candidate, UC Berkeley Counseling Intern at The James Morehouse Project SBHC, El Cerrito High School, Spring 2020",

They integrate a focus on academics with health, social services, community development and community engagement. A robust community school will include the following four pillars: <h3>SBHC/WCs Are Aligned with Community Schools</h3> California’s school-based health center & wellness center (SBHC/WC) model is a strong complementary asset to the goals and vision for community schools in the state. SBHC/WCs are a way for community schools to bring reliable, affordable, quality health and mental health care services to students and their families in an accessible and coordinated way. <h3>SBHC/WCs & Community Schools Work Together</h3> Our SBHC staff have developed a rare institutional trust with students, families, and community members, which is essential for providing care. The bottom line is that SBHCs provide essential health care in Oakland’s most high-need neighborhoods. – Curtiss Sarikey, Oakland Unified School District, from School-Based Health Centers: Trusted Lifelines in a Time of Crisis <h3>State Funding: California Community Schools Partnership Program</h3> The California Department of Education introduced a new investment for the planning, implementation, and support of community schools through the California Community Schools Partnership Program. RFAs for planning, implementation, and technical assistance grants have been released with coordination grants to be released soon. The first round of RFAs were due April 1, 2022, but the CDE plans to release another round for planning and implementation grants in the fall of 2022. The goal of this program is to improve student outcomes through supporting schools in partnering with community agencies and local governments. Funds through the Community Schools Partnership Program cannot be used for construction of School-based Health and Wellness Centers but can be used to purchase mobile health units to provide health, dental, vision and mental health services. LEAs can use this opportunity to launch new services using their own personnel, or partnering with community health providers. <h2>Learn More About CCSPP</h2> <h3>How LEAs & Partners Can Braid New Funding to Support SBHC/WCs</h3> The California School-Based Health Alliance (CSHA) has a Braided Funding Guide to assist in local planning and strategy that shows local education agencies (LEAs) and partners how they can braid together new state funding opportunities – including those for full-service community schools – to support new school-based health centers (SBHC/WCs) or expand and improve existing SBHC/WCs. <h2>See the Braided Funding Guide</h2> <h4>Resources</h4> The Coalition for Community Schools: The Coalition for Community Schools is a national organization advancing the community schools movement.

Organizations without a dedicated credit card have found solutions by using a supervisor’s or colleague’s card, requesting a one-time limit increase, or spreading transactions over multiple days to stay within card limits. Alternatively, some organizations work with their purchasing departments to initiate a requisition and convert it into a credit card payment instead of completing a purchase order.

Swipe to see more <h2>About School-Based Health</h2> School-based health centers and wellness centers (SBHCs/WCs) are an innovative way to help ensure that children and youth have access to health care and do well in school. A school-based health center (SBHC) is a student-focused health center or clinic located at or near a school that provides age-appropriate, medical services by clinicians. It may also provide behavioral health, dental, optometry, and/or ancillary services (i.e. health education, youth engagement, case management). A wellness center (WC) is a student-focused center located at or near a school that provides age-appropriate, clinical behavioral health services by providers. It may also provide non-medical ancillary services. Research has shown, and teachers and educators intuitively know, that healthier children are better students because they are able to focus in class and are not distracted by hunger, pain, stress, or a chronic illness. <h2>Get the Latest Information on School Health</h2> Sign up to receive our free newsletter and stay updated on learning opportunities and more.
