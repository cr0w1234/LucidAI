          "content": "<h2>Why Adopt Brief Interventions for Substance Use?</h2> Brief interventions are structured conversations designed to address alcohol and/or drug use among youth who are using substances, but do not need specialty SUD treatment. They are intended to be used when a young person screens positive for substance use or the need to discuss substance use emerges some other way. The goal of brief interventions is to have a discussion aimed at reinforcing a youth’s self-determination to reduce their risky behavior. Brief interventions are designed to be delivered in non-SUD treatment settings such as SBHCs. <h2>Motivational interviewing: The best way to conduct brief interventions</h2> Motivational interviewing is a collaborative, client-centered counseling style that guides individuals to elicit and strengthen their motivation for change. 4 Rather than advising youth that they “should” or “need to” stop using alcohol or drugs, providers use motivational interviewing to have open conversations, using reflective listening skills and other conversational techniques to mobilize a young person’s own intrinsic values as motivation to change their substance use. Research shows that motivational interviewing is the most effective tool for achieving meaningful and lasting changes in substance use behavior within a relatively brief time period. 5-6 Using motivational interviewing, providers can help youth identify their own reasons to either reduce substance use or stop altogether, and collaboratively develop strategies to achieve behavior change goals. <h3>What are some techniques for brief interventions?</h3> The Brief Negotiated Interview (BNI) is a semi structured interview process based on motivational interviewing and can be completed in 5-15 minutes. “What’s a typical day like for you? What do you like to do? How does Vicodin fit in?” “What do you like less about Vicodin? Do you ever regret using Vicodin?” If they can’t think of any cons, explore problems mentioned on the CRAFFT, i.e.: “You said that you have gotten into trouble while using Vicodin. Tell me more about that.” “So on one hand you enjoy Vicodin because….and on the other hand it has caused these problems…” “We know that use of opioids by young people has some negative consequences. They can lead to short-term problems like impaired ability to learn, family relationship issues, and overdose & death, along with long-term consequences like collapsed veins, respiratory problems, and liver disease.” “Young people who use prescription opioids in their early teens are more likely to be using heroin when they graduate from high school. Because your brain is still developing, opioids can cause permanent changes in your brain and make you more vulnerable to addiction as an adult.” “What do you think about this information?” Use to determine how ready the young person is to make a change, how important making a change is to them, or how confident they are that they will be able to make the change “Why did you choose that number and not a lower number, like a 1 or a 2?” “That’s great, it means you’re ___% ready to make a change.” Reflect their response and say: “So it sounds like you have some reasons to make a change.” “What do you want your life to look like down the road?” (Probe for goals) “How does this change fit in with those goals?” “What might be some challenges in accomplishing your goal with regard to Vicodin?” “What’s something you have accomplished in the past that you felt proud of? Who or what helped you succeed in that How can you use that (person or method) to help you with the challenges of making this change now?” “If you make this change, how would things be better for you?” (If available, present list of local resources) “Which of these services, if any, are you interested in to help you with your goal?” “OK, here’s the action plan we’ve discussed. This is really an agreement between you and yourself.” “Thanks so much for coming in and talking with me today! I’d love to see you come back in X weeks.” FLO stands for Feedback, Listen & Understand, and Options Explored. It takes 15 minutes and condenses the main elements of brief interventions into three steps. The provider is listening for their reasons for using substances (trying to understand them), and their reasons for reducing or stopping. “What would be some of the good things about cutting down or stopping your use of Vicodin?” is a question that directly “pulls” for change talk. The provider can offer options if the youth has difficulty coming up with their own ideas. Try to provide concrete examples of things they can do to reduce their risk of harm, e.g., not drinking or cutting back on the number of drinks per day. Remember that youth have a choice. Doing nothing is also an option. The provider can also offer to check in frequently. Very often, attention paid to one’s behavior can be an intervention. <h3>What are best practices when implementing brief interventions?</h3> Frequently Asked Questions about Minor Consent for Substance Use Disorder Services in California has information on Family Code 6929. Brief interventions, in conjunction with screening, should begin at age 12. Youth should receive brief interventions whenever they screen positive for a substance use screening. The provider (medical, behavioral health, or health education) should conduct the brief intervention with the young person while they are in a private room. The provider should also summarize the brief intervention in their chart notes. The next step depends on the level of intervention that the young person needs: In either case, a follow-up appointment should be scheduled so the SBHC provider can check in with the young person and ensure they are receiving the care they need. Yes, Teen Intervene is an example of a brief intervention program that can be done in groups. Teen Intervene is designed for mild to moderate cases of substance use. <h3>What should I do now?</h3> <h2>Download a Printable Guide</h2> Facilitating Change for Excellence in SBIRT – Guidance on using SBIRT from the National Council for Behavioral Health, Improving Adolescent Health Adolescent Substance Use Screening Overview – Resources on screening for adolescent substance use from the Conrad N.

          "content": "<h2>The Detrimental Intersection of Vaping & Youth Mental Health</h2> Over the past decade, there has been a notable surge in the number of young people turning to vaping products that contain nicotine, a trend exacerbated by the ongoing youth mental health crisis. Much of this rise can be attributed to the deceptive marketing tactics employed by the tobacco industry, leading many youths to perceive vaping as a means of stress relief. According to data from the Truth Initiative, a majority of youth who have used e-cigarettes started vaping to decrease their feelings of stress, anxiety or depression, and 50% of youth report they continue to vape to deal with stress or anxiety. While youth may turn to vaping to deal with their increasing stress, the evidence shows that vaping can have the opposite effect, actually worsening mental health symptoms, and creating a cycle of addiction that has negative consequences on the physical and mental health of youth. Many young people are unaware that vaping as a coping strategy may actually make them feel worse.  School health staff have a critical role in increasing awareness of the connections between youth vaping and mental well-being. <h2>The Nicotine Addiction Cycle</h2> An understanding of the nicotine addiction cycle can help to contextualize how vaping and other uses of nicotine intersects with mental health. The cycle starts once a young person uses a vape. This initial experience often includes moments of euphoria and improved mood, which can be intensely pleasurable. However, this pleasure is short-lived. As it dissipates, youth may repeatedly vape to try and recreate that pleasurable sensation. This repeated usage can quickly lead to the development of a high tolerance, ultimately resulting in nicotine dependence. This dependence manifests through withdrawal symptoms, which may trigger feelings of anxiety, irritability, and a focus on when they can vape next to recapture that sense of well-being. This cycle of craving perpetuates itself, creating a continuous loop. <h2>Nicotine Impact on the Brain</h2> Nicotine constricts blood vessels and increases heart rate. Research suggests that nicotine may trigger cortisol production which causes us to falsely believe that nicotine helps us manage stress more effectively. However, by regularly consuming a substance that replicates a stress response in our bodies when performing everyday tasks, we risk overexposing our bodies to cortisol and other stress hormones that disrupt the body’s processes and put us at risk for poor mental health. Nicotine also increases nicotinic receptors over time , which provides that stressful feeling every time those receptors aren’t getting nicotine. <h2>How School-Based Health Centers & Wellness Centers Can Support Youth with Addiction</h2> It’s important to remember that supporting youth with addiction is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a collaborative approach involving schools, school health partners, parents/guardians, and community resources. <h2>Therapeutic Interventions</h2>",

Peer education programs have demonstrated effectiveness in preventing youth tobacco use. 1 Cannabis: A plant containing two main chemicals that cause direct effects on the body, THC and CBD. Cannabis also refers to products derived from the plant Cannabis Sativa THC: Short for Tetrahyrodcannabinol, the ingredient that gives cannabis its addictive psychoactive property, meaning it will make the user feel “high” CBD: Short for Cannabidoil, CBD is a non-psychoactive compound found in cannabis plants. Unlike THC, it does not produce a “high” Other terms: There are well over 1000 names and slang terms for cannabis, including marijuana, bud, 420, pot, weed, mota, ganga, for example. Some of these terms carry cultural meaning and stigma, so we recommend using the term cannabis to remain as non-judgmental and factual as possible. <h3>The Role of SBHCs in Cannabis Use Education & Prevention</h3> School-based health centers and wellness centers (SBHCs/WCs) are well positioned to help students with cannabis use through prevention, health education, harm reduction, and cessation services. <h3>Youth-Friendly Approaches to Providing Effective Cannabis Education & Prevention Programs</h3> Ultimately, tackling cannabis and other substance use among youth requires a multifaceted approach that prioritizes prevention, education, and support. By promoting youth-friendly approaches and coping strategies, SBHCs can empower young individuals to make healthier choices and thrive despite the challenges they may face. The Stanford Tobacco Prevention Toolkit offers theory-based and evidence-informed resources created by educators, parents, and researchers aimed at preventing middle and high school students’ use of tobacco and nicotine. Stanford University has additional resources, including Safety First , the Cannabis Prevention Toolkit , the Vaping Information, Solutions, and Interventions Toolkit (VISIT) , and the Healthy Futures Curriculum , which is an alternative to suspensions education program for students caught using tobacco substances on campus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has useful information on current tobacco use among youth, factors associated with use, and recommendations on how to reduce use at the national, state, and local levels. The truth campaign has a website and media campaign geared toward youth and young adults. <h4>Resources for Parents</h4> The American Lung Association provides tips for talking to kids about smoking along with resources for parents who want to quit smoking. There are many resources out there for young people to learn more about the effects of tobacco and nicotine, but it can be overwhelming to read so much information. In hope of easing the burden and engaging more young people, CSHA put together some of the most youth-friendly tobacco education resources. These are select resources we believe youth would find the most relevant: Just Think Twice The Truth Campaign: Nicotine & Stress The Truth Campaign: Nicotine & Mental Health Smokefree.gov: Smoking & Physical Activity <h3>Tobacco Cessation Resources</h3> Interested in quitting tobacco, nicotine, or vaping?

          "content": "Have you heard of The Triangulum? The Triangulum refers to the interconnected relationship between tobacco, cannabis, and vaping/e-cigarettes. With the rapid rise of vapes and other delivery systems for tobacco and cannabis use, the landscape of “smoking” has changed significantly. Today, tobacco, cannabis and vaping are often related and used together. For example, a person might smoke a joint that contains both cannabis and tobacco, or use a vape that contains cannabis abstracts. It is common for youth to use both tobacco and cannabis, either at the same time, one after the other, or in combination with other substances, especially since vaping devices for both tobacco and cannabis are widely available and can often be used for multiple substances. In California, more young people now use e-cigarettes than traditional cigarettes, and cannabis use is higher than all tobacco use combined. 1 There is a strong link between using tobacco and cannabis. Additionally, the tobacco and cannabis products themselves and delivery systems, including vapes, edibles, combustible wraps, tinctures, are constantly changing, making it difficult for the consumer to understand the potency and risks associated with use. Historically, resources and support for tobacco use and cannabis use have been separate, largely due to distinct funding sources. However, understanding how tobacco, cannabis and vaping are linked is essential, and helps us find better ways to prevent and reduce their use, especially among young people. The Triangulum framework compels us to reduce the silos around different substances, and offer comprehensive drug education, prevention, and intervention that recognizes the intersections and complexity. <h2>Resources</h2> These resources can be used with elementary, middle, and/or high school students.

      "content": "School-based health centers and wellness centers (SBHC/WC) and other school health professionals can play an important role in enhancing school climate, particularly in improving student behavior and rethinking disciplinary approaches. Many schools have begun to move away from zero-tolerance disciplinary policies and to acknowledge the social, emotional, and physical factors that shape student behavior. Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) is an increasingly popular approach. It engages all stakeholders—including teachers, administrators, service providers, and families—in actively teaching and reinforcing expected behavior. PBIS prompts schools to identify and meet student needs that manifest as inappropriate behavior, reducing serious problems and improving overall climate. Mental health specialists and other school health staff can be integral to the assessment process, through which the underlying causes of a student’s disruptive behavior are identified. SBHCs can also lead the implementation of alternative behavioral interventions, such as anger management sessions, leadership development programming, individual and group counseling sessions, and peer support groups. According to the Center for School, Health and Education at the American Public Health Association, SBHCs have a “natural role” and are a “powerful ally” in efforts to improve school climate. <h2>Police in Schools</h2> Black-led and youth-led community-based organizations have been advocating and organizing for police-free school campuses for years. School-based health centers and the young people they serve tell us that students need more supportive services – like primary care, behavioral health and restorative justice – instead of school police. The deaths of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and many other Black Americans brought systemic racism and police violence into sharper focus. At the California School-Based Health Alliance, our incredible Youth Board in 2020 strongly encouraged us in our role as advocates for student health to take a position against schools investing in police on campus. We have joined these brave leaders and partners by taking a position to support advocacy efforts in California to eliminate police in schools. We believe that school funds should go to student learning and health, and not police. <h2>Our Position on Police in Schools</h2> Instead of increasing school safety, research shows that the presence of school police officers has a harmful effect on all students of color and particularly Black students. SBHC/WCs and school health services play an important role in supporting positive school climates for all students, especially those that face the greatest health and education disparities. As an alternative to police, we believe that school investments should focus on practices and services that promote a positive school climate that protects every young person and their dignity. It also includes age-appropriate, non-punitive services that address student behaviors and underlying needs. Strong evidence indicates that non-punitive approaches are associated with high levels of academic achievement, healthy student development, and safe learning environments. We continue to support all schools as they strive to create environments where all students can thrive. <h2>Chronic Absenteeism</h2> Swipe to see more <h2>School Discipline Reform</h2> Swipe to see more Swipe to see more",

          "content": "According to the American Medical Association, consent occurs when communication between a patient and provider results in the patient’s agreement to undergo a specific medical service.  In school-based health, most young people are under the age of 18 and therefore need their parent or guardian to consent to treatment on behalf of them for most services.  In California, we have minor consent laws which enable young people aged 12 and over to consent to some services. Minor consent laws allow young people aged 12 and over to consent to certain services without parent or guardian involvement.  Minors may consent to certain services related to sexual and reproductive health, mental health, and drug and alcohol treatment.   When a young person accesses services under minor consent laws, those services are to be maintained confidentially – meaning that providers are bound by law to not share this information, including with parents/guardians. In order to receive services, not only does a person need to consent to them, but they also need to be able to access them.  School-based health and wellness centers (SBHC/WCs) increase access to services by offering them in a place that is familiar, trusted, and convenient – in school. SBHC/WCs play a unique role for young people consenting to services under minor consent laws.  Not only do SBHC/WCs increase access to minor consent services but also they enable young people to access these services in a truly confidential manner.  Young people who need minor consent services do not have to worry about transportation to and from their appointment and can have their absence from class excused.  SBHC/WCs help enable young people to consent and access services that they are entitled to by California law. <h2>Minor Consent Laws</h2> <h4>Minor Consent Mental Health Rights in California (AB 665)</h4> Assembly Bill 665, signed by the Governor in October 2023, created a new minor consent mental health right in California.  This bill aligns the existing laws by authorizing a minor who is 12 years of age or older to consent to mental health treatment or counseling on an outpatient basis if the minor is mature enough to participate.  This bill also aligns the existing laws by requiring the professional person treating or counseling the minor to consult with the minor before determining whether involvement of the minor’s parent or guardian would be inappropriate. <h4>Minor Consent Medical Rights in California (AB 816)</h4> Assembly Bill 816, signed by the Governor in October 2023, created a new minor consent medical right in California.  This bill authorizes a minor who is 16 years of age or older to consent to replacement narcotic abuse treatment that uses buprenorphine at a physician’s office, clinic, or health facility, by a licensed physician and surgeon or other health care provider, whether or not the minor also has the consent of their parent or guardian. <h4>Minor Consent Reproductive Health Rights in California (AB 499)</h4> Assembly Bill 499, signed by the Governor in October 2011, created a new minor consent health right in California. Previously, the law allowed minors to consent to diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, but did not allow them to consent to services that would prevent sexually transmitted diseases. Under AB 499, adolescents aged 12 and over can give their own consent for services that prevent sexually transmitted diseases, including the HPV vaccine, the Hep B vaccine, and post-exposure HIV prophylaxis. AB 499 amended section 6296 of the Family Code. <h2>Minor Consent Resources</h2> National Center for Youth Law’s California Minor Consent and Confidentiality Laws grid.

      "content": "<h2>Students Helping Students</h2> Peer-to-peer mental health support can be an effective strategy for supporting student behavioral health. There is growing interest in bringing peer-to-peer mental health support programs to schools, and peer programs are part of a larger shift in the approach to school mental health that centers prevention, early intervention, cultural relevance and social-emotional skill development. Peer programs can complement and strengthen traditional school mental health programs. As youth move through adolescence, they increasingly turn to their peers for support, advice, and to talk through difficult experiences. Peer-to-peer support models create supportive relationships between youth, and can be particularly helpful for youth who might be resistant to traditional behavioral health models. Peer-to-peer programs can equip youth with essential accurate information on behavioral health, communication skills to talk with and support one another, and connections to mental health resources and trusted adults. <h3>Why Peer-to-Peer Mental Health Supports?</h3> <h3>Starting a Peer-to-Peer Program</h3> Peer-to-peer programs can be implemented as part of a school’s comprehensive school mental health approach to support student well-being. In considering starting a peer-to-peer program, it is essential to take the time to evaluate your particular school’s unique needs, strengths, resources, student and staff composition to develop an effective program. <h3>Questions to Explore</h3> <h2>Principles of Effective Peer to Peer Programs</h2> There are many examples of effective school-based peer-to-peer programs that equip students with skills and knowledge while giving them opportunities to provide support to their peers.  These programs shared many of the following principles in their design and implementation. <h2>Peer-to-Peer Mental Health Support Models</h2> <h3>Continuum of Peer-to-Peer Support Programs</h3> There are a number of effective models of school-based peer-to-peer support, and it is important to determine what model is the best fit for a specific school community. Some models can be initiated fairly easily with interested students and an adult advisor, requiring little to no funding. Other models require a much higher level or staff support, oversight, and incorporation into the school master calendar. Similarly, more intensive peer-to-peer models, such as peer counseling, require higher levels of training for both the peers and the adult leader. <h2>Models to Consider</h2> <h3>Peer-Designed/Led Safe Spaces</h3> Engaging students to envision and create safe wellness spaces for students on campus can be a starting place for building a peer-to-peer culture. Students can poll their peers, facilitate focus groups, and engage with adult allies to create and lead these spaces. <h3>Wellness Ambassadors</h3> An accessible entry point into peer-to-peer support is a student-led club where youth are trained in mental health literacy, stigma reduction, and community engagement. Organizations such as NAMI on Campus, Bring Change to Mind, and Sources of Strength offer resources and support to schools who want to start a club. See links to their websites below for specific information about each. <h3>Peer Health Educators</h3> Peer health education can be an effective model for disseminating health information that is important to youth  in a way that youth can best hear it – from their peers.  Peer health educators are trained to provide school-wide trainings through classroom presentations, assemblies, lunch time activities etc. on a range of health topics. Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram are often used by peer health educators to creatively reach their peers with accurate, meaningful mental health information. <h3>Wellness Peers</h3> Wellness Peers are youth recruited to participate in the design and implementation of  Wellness Centers, and serve both as support for students who use the center as well as ambassadors in the school community.  Young people are often the best ambassadors for a SBHC or Wellness Center.  They have the trust of their peers and can speak authentically about the vibe, the services, and adult staff. Wellness Peers help students who are using the Wellness Center sign-in, understand the rules, and connect them to some of the self-regulating, calming stations. <h3>Restorative Justice Peer Leaders/Culture Keepers</h3> Restorative Justice Peer Leaders are trained to support their school community by leading restorative justice circles that build, repair and restore relationships.  Culture Keepers is a model that trains peers to lead mindfulness, meditation and restorative practices and facilitate peer conflict mediations.  Both models can offer a powerful alternative to more traditional disciplinary approaches when students act out or conflict arises. <h3>Peer Counseling/Peer Mentoring</h3> Peer Counseling and Mentoring Peer models are high-intensity peer programs that train youth in very specific communication and interpersonal skills who will then use those skills in a systematic and well-thought out way to provide services to each other. Often, these programs are organized through an elective class taught by a teacher with mental health training and with access to clinical support. Peers will offer one-on-support to other students, and be held to high standards. Training includes lots of opportunities for practice and role plays, training on documentation for all peer sessions, and identification of red flags that require referral. <h3>Peer Specialists/Certified Wellness Coaches</h3> Peer Specialists are paraprofessionals or young adults who have experienced similar challenges and completed specialized training to learn how to use their experience to support other youth. Peer specialists offer a range of activities and interactions focussed on promoting connection, inspiring hope, and supporting youth to set their own goals. Wellness Coaches are a new workforce program being rolled out by the state as part of the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative (CYBHI), aimed at building a more diverse behavioral health workforce in schools. <h2>Recommendations for District Leaders</h2>",

Complete our survey or contact us so we can add it! School-based health and wellness centers are located in schools serving some of the state’s most vulnerable children. On campuses with SBHCs, about 70% of students receive free or reduced price meals. Students in communities that benefit from school-based health centers and wellness centers are less likely to have health insurance or access to health and mental health services that address these risk factors. Without access to high-quality health services, childhood risk factors are more likely to be translated into higher rates of diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and other chronic illnesses in adulthood as well as more struggles with academic success. Of California’s 400 school-based health and wellness centers: Most of California’s SBHCs/WCs are physically located right on campus within a main building or in a portable. In some areas, health services are provided by mobile medical or dental vans, and in other areas, “school-linked” health centers are off campus and have formal operating agreements with schools.",

      "link": "https://dev-chsa-ai.pantheonsite.io/resource/chronic-absence/",
      "content": "<h2>School-Based Health Centers & Wellness Centers Can Help Schools Reduce Absence</h2> Because chronic absenteeism is the result of complex mental, physical, and family health issues, school-based health centers and wellness centers (SBHCs/WCs) can play an integral part in strategically addressing attendance problems. In collaboration with educators, health center staff can identify and support students with unmet health needs so they can re-engage with school. Doing so improves student health and increases school attendance. 1 At Elsa Widenmann Elementary School in Vallejo City Unified School District, educators saw an opportunity to reduce absenteeism by establishing a school-based health center. As former principal MaBella Gonzales explains, “Our concern was attendance, and how many non-urgent health needs were preventing children from coming to school. As we worked with our collaborative partners [to establish our new school-based health center] we wanted to create a hub for our school community where information and resources were available to support the health, well-being and positive lifestyles of students and families.” <h2>Steps to Reduce Chronic Absence</h2> <h3>1. Work with Administrators and the Attendance Office</h3> Establish a mechanism for working with administrators and the attendance office to identify students who are chronically absent and have them referred to the school-based health center (SBHC). If you are able to participate in the school’s analysis of attendance data, you may find the following tools useful; if you are not able to participate in that process for privacy reasons, you may want to share the tools with school partners. <h4>Tools for Collecting and Analyzing Student Attendance Data</h4> <h3>2. Participate in the School’s Absenteeism Intervention Team</h3> This team should use an interdisciplinary process to identify and respond to the needs of chronically absent students. Such teams may be focused on attendance (e.g. School Attendance Review Team, or SART) or may address students’ needs more broadly (e.g. Coordination of Services Team, or COST). If your school does not have such a team, the health center should consider spearheading this effort. <h4>Learn More About SARTs:</h4> <h4>Learn More About Related State-Level Efforts:</h4> <h3>3. Conduct Health and Psychosocial Assessments</h3> Conduct health and psychosocial assessments of chronically absent students and then either deliver indicated services or refer them to additional services not provided by your school health center. When possible, help patients and families make appointments with outside providers to ensure access to care. One successful example of a nurse practitioner-led effort to conduct assessments with chronically absent students is outlined in this research article: Does Contact by a Family Nurse Practitioner Decrease Early School Absence? <h3>4. Interview Chronically Absent Students and Families</h3> Interview chronically absent students and families to better understand the barriers to school attendance that they are experiencing and the types of incentives and supports that will re-engage them in school. This is particularly important for high school students, as they are more likely to make their own decisions about whether or not they will attend school, so attendance incentives should be determined by the teens they target. <h3>5. Consult with School Administrators on Disciplinary Policies</h3> Consult with school administrators on disciplinary policies to promote progressive disciplinary policies that address the causes of misbehavior rather than suspending or expelling students. <h3>6. Conduct Home Visits</h3> When you can’t reach chronically absent students or their families at school, conduct home visits to make personal contact. When possible, perform home visits in partnership with another school or health center staff member. When you find a student or family member at home, establish a non-threatening, non-judgmental approach by conveying your concern about the student’s absence, and inquiring as to how you might be able to help him/her attend school more regularly. It is not important to enter the home; even a brief conversation at the door and a personal invitation to come to the health center will help to build trust with the student and family. <h4>Home Visiting Resources and Training Opportunities</h4> <h3>7. Provide Case Management</h3> Provide ongoing, individual case management for chronically absent students and families. <h4>Case Management Resources and Training Opportunities</h4> 1 Lewallen, T., Hunt, H., Potts-Datema, W., Zaza, S., Giles, W.

      "content": "The number of school-based health centers continues to grow because the need is great and impact is deep. Doctors know it: When we can prevent health issues from developing into something worse, that to me epitomizes the strength of a school-based health center. Educators see it: The reality is that many of our children come to school sick because they have nowhere else to go. So it just makes sense to have a school-based health clinic as a key component to providing a quality education. Students feel it: Our school health center has everything! Comfort. Respect. Honesty. School is a hard place for many young people. They might be labeled as ‘low achieving’ or ‘angry,’ ‘apathetic’ or ‘defiant.’ When these young people come into a space that lifts up their hopes and dreams, they are able to re-position themselves in their own lives and within the school community as activists, artists, advocates and leaders. This chance to matter, to be an agent of change, has a profound impact on young people’s sense of themselves and their imaginative capacity to hold a positive future.

      "content": "Some health services are required for all students by California Education Code or Health and Safety Code, and others are required for certain students as outlined in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). These services are typically provided by school personnel, such as school nurses, but they may be provided by other staff depending on the level of service and related legal or credentialing requirements. School nursing programs focus on the prevention of illness and disability and the early detection and correction of health problems. As registered nurses, school nurses can assess for health problems (e.g., conduct vision and hearing screenings), deliver some health services (e.g., administer immunizations and insulin), and provide health education to students, families and staff; they often also coordinate school or district-wide health programs. Read more about the role of school nurses or visit the California School Nurses Organization website. The primary mandated school health services are: See this summary of selected California Education Code and California Health and Safety Code. <h3>Special Education-Related Services</h3> These include health assessments and treatments required for students with disabilities, as indicated by a student’s Individualized Education Program (IEP) and as outlined in IDEA. School nurses, school psychologists, speech therapists and other health professionals may be involved in both initial and triennial special education health assessments, as well as indicated treatments, such as gastric tube feedings or catheterizations. <h3>School-Based Prescription Medication Administration</h3> This is sometimes required for students whose education may be impeded by a health condition that requires administration of a prescription medication during school hours. Any student who is required to take medication prescribed for him by a physician may be assisted by the school nurse or other designated school personnel if the school district receives (1) a written statement from such physician detailing the method, amount, and time schedules by which such medication is to be taken and (2) a written statement from the parent or guardian of the student indicating the desire that the school district assist the student in the matters set forth in the physician’s statement. See the California Department of Education’s Program Advisory on Medication Administration . <h3>Vision, Hearing and Scoliosis Screenings</h3> These are required at specific intervals and grade levels in California. Schools must conduct vision screening on all students upon school entry and every third year thereafter through grade eight. For example, vision testing may be done in kindergarten or first grade and in grades two, five, and eight, as well as on enrollment and referral at any grade level. Learn more about vision screening . Hearing screening is mandated in kindergarten/first grade and in second, fifth, eighth, tenth/eleventh grade and upon first school entry (California Code of Regulations, Title 17, Section 2952 (c)(1)) . Hearing screening in California public schools must be conducted by a credentialed school audiometrist – guidance from CDE here . Note that Local Education Authorities may apply for a waiver for the high school hearing testing requirement.The state scoliosis screening mandate was suspended and it is uncertain whether it will be reinstated. Some school districts continue to conduct scoliosis screenings for girls in seventh grade and boys in eighth grade. Learn more about scoliosis screening . <h4>Other Health Requirements</h4> See other resources on oral health screening , and school health requirements for certain immunizations .",

      "content": "<h2>Practices to Increase Healing & Trauma-Informed Services at School-Based Health and Wellness Centers</h2> Trauma refers to distressing experiences—such as abuse, neglect, family or community violence, poverty, or forced displacement—that can significantly impact a child’s mental and physical health. When prolonged, trauma can lead to toxic stress, a chronic activation of the stress response that disrupts brain development and affects learning, relationships, and overall well-being. Children and adolescents are especially vulnerable to these effects. At the California School-Based Health Alliance (CSHA), we support trauma-informed, healing-centered, and resilience-focused approaches in schools and school-based wellness centers across California. We also recognize the impact of sociocultural trauma—including racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, ableism, classism, and other forms of systemic oppression—which shapes students’ everyday experiences and can intensify traditional forms of trauma, such as violence, natural disasters, medical trauma, and loss. Creating trauma-informed schools requires addressing this full spectrum of trauma with cultural humility and a deep commitment to ongoing reflection on power, privilege, and equity. It’s not a one-time training, but a long-term shift in mindset and practice.",

The pandemic laid bare the increasing need for health and mental health supports, as well as the low access to those services for historically marginalized communities. As the statewide organization leading the movement to put health care in schools, particularly through school-based health centers and wellness centers (SBHCs/WCs), the California School-Based Health Alliance has made available the Student Health Index – newly updated in 2023 – to identify the counties, districts, and schools where new SBHCs will have the greatest return on investment for improving student health and education equity. <h3>The Data Dashboard Is an Advocacy Tool for More SBHCs</h3> To make the Student Health Index more accessible, a dashboard was created that allows users to view and explore the data through a variety of maps and tables. The Dashboard – updated in 2023 – provides a new way to look at health and educational data together.

          "link": "https://dev-chsa-ai.pantheonsite.io/resource/student-health-index/methodology/",
          "content": "The California Student Health Index was constructed by incorporating information gleaned from the analysis of the landscape of existing indices and publicly available datasets. <h4>The Student Health Index:</h4> <h4>Calculating Need Scores for schools entails three steps:</h4> <h4>The indicators used were:</h4> <h2>Merging & Spatially Linking Datasets</h2> Data in the model comes from a variety of sources. To simplify reproducibility, all census-tract level data is sourced from the UCSF Health Atlas, an interactive population health mapping website that curates publicly available data and displays it at the census tract level in California. All school-level data comes from the California Department of Education’s (CDE) Downloadable Data Files site. Data on COVID vaccination rates is collected at the zip code level by the California Department of Health and Human Services. The CDE data is available in distinct data files that must be merged using the 14-digit school code that uniquely identifies each school within California. For example, data on suspension rates, race and ethnicity, chronic absenteeism, school location, and free and reduced-price lunch eligibility are available in separate data files. In total, this analysis required the merging of five different CDE datasets. The CDE Public Schools and Districts Data Files contain a latitude and longitude for each school location, which were spatially joined with the data from their underlying census tracts using Stata’s spatial data analysis package. Thus, the final, cleaned dataset contains information on each school’s characteristics, as well as underlying census tract characteristics. Vaccination rates are linked on the school’s zip code. <h2>Rescaling Indicators</h2> The diverse indicators that comprise the Student Health Index include percentages, rates, and index values. To include them in a composite measure, each is transformed to enable comparisons on a common scale, using percentiles. Thus, performance on an indicator is compared with the highest and lowest scores obtained on that indicator. Specifically, the index draws on 14 indicators related to socioeconomic factors and health outcomes at the school and neighborhood (census tract) level. Each school is given a score of 1-4 for each indicator, based on the quartile that indicator falls into relative to all other schools. For example, a school with a very high percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals would receive a score of 4, while a school with few such students would receive a score of 1. <h2>Calculating & Weighting the Opportunity Scores & Grades</h2> The calculation methodology was based off the methodologies used by the model indices (see Full Report for more information). Because school-level data is more specific to the individual school context than community-level data, it is double weighted for the purpose of this analysis. All school-level scores are doubled, creating scores of 2-8 for school data. All scores are then added up across all 14 indicators, creating a Need Score ranging from 19 to 73. This score is again broken into four categories using quartiles, which allowed for the creation of the Student Health Index. Each school is thus designated as either highest need, higher need, lower need, and lowest need. <h2>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</h2> The schools included in the Index were selected intentionally based on specified inclusion criteria. California had over 10,000 active public schools at the start of the 2021-22 school year, according to data from the California Department of Education. The goal of this analysis was to create a list of locations to target for additional health care services, and thus for the purpose of this analysis, schools that met certain criteria were excluded from the list of schools that were statistically analyzed. The exclusion criteria are as follows: Using these criteria, a little over 8,000 public schools were selected for relative needs analysis. Schools with existing SBHCs were included in the index, in part so that the CSHA can determine whether these centers are currently located at relatively high need schools. These schools can be filtered out of the online resource and associated dataset according to data users’ interests and needs. Table 2: Number and Type of Schools in Final List Contact us if you would like to receive the complete data set associated with this analysis, including a list of schools included in the index. <h2>Differentiating Rural & Urban Schools</h2> Because rural schools generally are smaller and serve a population with different access to urban infrastructure such as health clinics and public transit, urban and rural schools were analyzed separately. The same indicators were used, but each indicator was given a relative score based on all other schools in the same rural or urban classification. Thus, a high need urban school is ranked only in comparison to other urban schools, and a high need rural school is high need relative to other rural schools.",

      "content": "<h2>Why School Behavioral Health Matters</h2> Schools are uniquely positioned to play an important, and potentially leading role in supporting the prevention and treatment of behavioral health challenges. Many students receive behavioral health services at their school: In fact, seventy percent of children receiving services get them at school, and the school environment is often a place of protection and security for them. 1,2 <h2>SBHCs: The Model for Providing Behavioral  Health Support in Schools</h2> School-based health and wellness centers (SBHC/WCs) provide accessible, age-appropriate primary care and evidence-based screenings to identify students that have underlying behavioral health needs – such as substance use, suicide, trauma, safety, and social determinants of health. SBHCs address the other health care needs that often co-occur with mental health conditions. They identify treatable concerns earlier than siloed mental health services alone. 3 SBHCs are set up in a way that feels safe and acceptable to students and their families, helping them access care from trusted adults early and often. <h3>Making Schools & Classrooms Trauma-Informed</h3> Due to the impact trauma can have on youth, the California School-Based Health Alliance works to identify best practices for trauma-informed, healing-centered, and resilience-focused work in schools and school-based health and wellness centers in California. Download our tool to support school leaders and staff in assessing their use of restorative, trauma-informed practices, and to identify the strengths and areas of improvement for cultivating a restorative, trauma-informed school. Our online toolkit aims to provide resources and lessons learned on how SBHC/WCs can increase trauma-informed practices and student resilience. Swipe to see more <h3>Tips for Effective School-Based Mental Health Services</h3> To have the greatest positive impact, school-based behavioral health services should be fully integrated into the everyday functioning of the school by following these best practices: <h4>Getting Started</h4> Districts interested in expanding or enhancing behavioral health services for students should ask themselves these key questions: What are the needs of our students, based upon data from sources such as California Healthy Kids Survey, Youth Risk Behavior Survey, suspension/expulsion data, and special education data? How are students involved in assessing, planning, and implementing behavioral health services? What behavioral health resources do we now have on campus? Do we have school-site behavioral health staff? How are current services coordinated? Are they effective? How are services meeting the unique cultural needs of our students? What do our teachers and school staff need to know to support student behavioral health? Who are our existing behavioral health partners? Who are potential partners? To what degree is the county health department invested in schools? Who are the principal players and leaders? Who needs to be involved in designing systems and implementing services to ensure all student needs are met? How do we measure success? How are we going to pay for and sustain services? Districts interested in expanding or enhancing behavioral health services for students should ask themselves these key questions: <h2>Suicide Prevention</h2> The aim of this toolkit from the San Diego County Office of Education is to share protocols, templates and resources that align with best practices in suicide intervention.

Engaging families, students, and local leaders isn’t just a step in the process — it’s the foundation for long-term success. At middle and high school SBHCs , youth are at the heart of everything . Their voices matter, and their engagement is not only a way to improve services — it’s an opportunity to empower young people to take charge of their own health. Explore our youth engagement resources to see how to make youth a driving force in your SBHC/WC success. SBHCs/WCs are built to respond to each community’s unique needs, which means providing culturally relevant and linguistically accessible care. Students and families should feel seen, heard, and respected from the first visit. That’s why cultural humility and language access are at the core of what we do. Use these resources to ensure your school health program offers care that reflects the community’s needs. <h3>Culturally Responsive Practice & Care</h3> The Center for Health and Health Care in Schools offers resources and research on cultural competence in health programs at schools. The Center of Excellence for Infant & Early Childhood Mental Health Consultation is a clearinghous e for high-quality resources on Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health Consultation (IECMHC). EthnoMed website of the Harborview Medical Center in Seattle contains information about cultural beliefs, medical issues and other related issues pertinent to the health care of recent immigrants to the United States, many of whom are refugees fleeing war-torn parts of the world. L.A. Care Health Plan designed a toolkit for health care providers to better serve culturally diverse patients. It includes information and tips on various cultural backgrounds to improve communication with patients. Developed by the Center for Community Learning and University of South Florida, this toolkit provides implementation strategies and practices that can be used in healthcare services and settings. This toolkit is meant to improve the quality of care and increase health equity through holistically, culturally, and linguistically appropriate services. The U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights English Learner toolkit provides information on how to better engage families with limited English proficiency and how to better integrate them into student learning. FAMILY & COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT RESOURCES The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) created Parent Engagement: Strategies for Involving Parents in School Health . This resource defines and describes parent engagement and identifies specific strategies and actions that schools can take to increase parent engagement in school health activities. Community Engagement in Public Health introduces a conceptual framework for community engagement in public health, highlighting real examples from Contra Costa County. It presents the Ladder of Community Participation as a way to illustrate a range of approaches that can be used to engage communities around both traditional and emerging public health issues. The National School Boards Association published Family as Partners: Fostering Family Engagement for Healthy and Successful Students , a resource to help school leaders effectively engage families in schools, particularly around school health issues. Moving Beyond Parent Involvement to Parent Engagement is a toolkit designed by the Michigan Department of Education. It gives concrete examples and rubrics outlining how teachers can reach out to parents and make them feel comfortable as partners in their child’s welfare. California Project LEAN (CPL) developed Parents in Action! Toolkit to support parent efforts to improve the school environment with an emphasis on healthy food and physical activity.

Asthma is the most common cause of disability among children in the U.S. and is the leading cause of school absences due to chronic disease. School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) are uniquely positioned to comprehensively address asthma in order to help children breathe easier. While many SBHCs across the country have always played a key role in helping students manage their asthma by providing quality clinical care and education, in recent years, SBHCs have demonstrated they can also be leaders in managing the environmental factors that make asthma worse. In 2015, Regional Asthma Management & Prevention (RAMP) and California School-Based Health Alliance (CSHA) developed the Asthma Environmental Intervention Guide for School-Based Health Centers, describing ﬁve broad strategies for reducing environmental asthma triggers: education, case management, improving indoor air quality in schools, improving home environments, and improving outdoor air quality. Since that time, we have supported twenty-seven SBHCs across the country in implementing these interventions. Based on their experiences, we have identiﬁed six key tips to follow, regardless of which intervention you choose. This document shares lessons learned, best practices, and tips for success.",

Container trucks carry goods to and from the Port of Oakland, U.S. Postal Service trucks carry mail to a major distribution center, and trucks and automobiles move overhead on freeways that surround the community.(6) The California Air Resources Board (CARB) conducted a health risk assessment and reported that West Oakland residents are exposed to high concentrations of diesel particulate matter—almost three times higher than the average background levels in the Bay Area.(7) The population is predominantly African-American and 35% of residents live below the federal poverty line.(8) Asthma is a significant public health concern for this community. Rates for Emergency Department visits due to asthma are higher in Alameda County than for the state and West Oakland children go to the Emergency Department with asthma almost twice as often as the county average. The West Oakland Middle School has 220 students enrolled and over 50 have been diagnosed with asthma and many more report undiagnosed respiratory concerns. The West Oakland Middle School (WOMS) Health Center recognized the disproportionate burden of asthma in their community and chose to prioritize asthma as one of the key health issues they address at their clinic. Run by Lifelong Medical, the WOMS Health Center developed an asthma management program based on national clinical guidelines. Components of their asthma management program include: Although spirometry is only used by 52% of providers, we know that it is an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of asthma and are committed to providing the highest standard of care . Kristine Carter, Nurse Practitioner They also conduct asthma education in a group setting at their clinic. They work with an AmeriCorps: Community Health Corp volunteer to conduct the foursession training which covers: what asthma is; recognizing symptoms; understanding medications; and identifying and reducing exposure to environmental triggers at home, school, and in the community. Students are hesitant about coming to class, but are always excited to share what they have learned and used . Aaron Steinfeld, Community Health Corp Volunteer The staff at the WOMS Health Center were eager to strengthen their asthma program in the fall by adding a component that directly addresses the air pollution in West Oakland through implementing the EPA’s Flag Program. The Flag Program uses different colored flags to inform students, school staff, and the community of daily air quality conditions. The flag colors correspond to the colors used in EPA’s Air Quality Index (AQI), which tells how clean or polluted the air is for that day. Sharing the daily air quality through these highly visible flags increases awareness about air pollution. In addition to raising awareness, the flag program also serves as important guidance for modifying physical activity in order to protect the health and well-being of students. We know that our program is working and we’re excited to expand it to other locations to help children all across Oakland breathe easier . Hana Shirriel-Dia, Health Center Supervisor In addition to expanding the breadth of their asthma program, the staff have plans to expand their reach. They will be expanding their own clinic services to include students from a nearby Charter Middle School. Additionally, they plan to replicate their comprehensive asthma program in another school-based health center run by Lifelong Medical in East Oakland, CA.

      "content": "<h2>A California Guide for Sharing Student Health and Education Information</h2> The goal of A California Guide for Sharing Student Health and Education Information is to strengthen and expand partnerships between education agencies and school-based health programs. This guidance is for information purposes only. Readers are encouraged to consult legal counsel and to confer with current federal and state laws. This information was obtained from the HIPAA or FERPA? A Primer on Sharing School Health Information in California , 2018. <h3>Introduction</h3> School-based health programs and providers bring a range of needed health care services to a school campus. These programs also provide an exciting opportunity to increase health care access for youth and improve care coordination and collaboration among providers and schools. This guide provides an overview of the laws that relate to sharing student/patient information (HIPAA, FERPA and California State Law), as well as best practices and resource materials for schools and health providers. When developing school-based health programs, there are several legal considerations that the health provider(s) and education agencies should address early on. One of the most important is determining which confidentiality laws control access to and disclosure of the school-based health programs’ health care information. <h3>HIPAA or FERPA?</h3> While there may be multiple laws to consider, the first question to address is whether the program’s information is subject to the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) or the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). What is HIPPA? The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule is a federal law that protects the privacy of patient health information held by “covered entities.” 1 What is FERPA? The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects the privacy of students’ personal records held by “educational agencies or institutions” that receive federal funds under programs administered by the U.S. Secretary of Education. 29 <h3>Feeling Unsure?</h3> There are a number of common questions regarding school-based health as well as HIPAA and FERPA. Below are links to role-based frequently asked HIPAA – FERPA questions relating to the records and communication of a… Parent/Guardian Medical Provider School Administrator Behavioral Health Provider School Nurse Student <h2>Key Points About HIPPA FERPA in California</h2> Whether HIPAA or FERPA applies and how those laws interact with state confidentiality law will impact school-based health service operations in large and small ways: <h3>How HIPAA & FERPA Interact</h3> The following video includes content based on laws, not ethics, clinic policy, or best practice. Simply because you can share information without an authorization form in some instances, doesn’t mean you always should. Sometimes ethics and your client relationship are more critical. Other times, your clinic policy recommends or requires that you obtain client consent/authorization before making a disclosure. This video provides legal information only and is accurate as of June 2020. To understand how this information might apply to you or to a specific situation, please seek legal counsel for specific advice. The content for this video was developed by Rebecca Gudeman at the National Center for Youth Law in partnership with the California School-Based Health Alliance. <h3>What is HIPAA?</h3> The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule is a federal law that protects the privacy of patient health information held by “covered entities.” 1 <h4>What information is protected under HIPAA?</h4> The HIPAA Privacy Rule limits covered health providers from disclosing what HIPAA calls “protected health information” (PHI). 8 “Protected health information” is individually identifiable health information in any form, including oral communications as well as written or electronically transmitted information. 9 Protected health information does not include information subject to FERPA. HIPAA explicitly states that health information held in an education record subject to FERPA is not “protected health information.” 10 In other words, if FERPA applies, HIPAA does not, and FERPA and HIPAA can never apply to the same information at the same time. <h4>How do HIPAA and California law intersect?</h4> California has its own laws that protect the confidentiality of medical and mental health information. 11 One of the most comprehensive set of statutes is called the California  Confidentiality of  Medical Information Act  (CMIA) .  It applies to medical information held by the health care providers, health care services plans and contractors, as each is defined in state law. 12 The CMIA parallels HIPAA in many ways; however, in some situations, it actually provides greater confidentiality protections than HIPAA. Federal privacy regulations under HIPAA usually supersede – or “preempt” – state laws, but HIPAA states that if a state’s law is more protective of individual privacy, then providers should follow the state law. 13 Thus, California health providers typically are following both HIPAA and state law. There are two other ways that California law becomes particularly important to understanding HIPAA. HIPAA grants rights to sign authorizations and to access a minor’s protected health information based in part on who is authorized to make health decisions for the minor. State law determines who has those consent rights in many cases. 14 Similarly, HIPAA says a parent’s right to access records when the parent did not consent for the child’s care will depend in part on state law. Finally, it is important to note that in addition to state and federal statute, licensed health professionals may practice under state ethical and licensing regulations that also include obligations related to confidentiality. These principles may impose greater confidentiality obligations than HIPAA. <h4>What administrative requirements must a provider satisfy under HIPAA?</h4> If a provider operates under HIPAA, it must meet all the administrative requirements in HIPAA and CMIA. This includes but is not limited to making sure the provider has a HIPAA-compliant “Notice of Privacy Practices” that it shares with clients 28 , a HIPAA and CMIA-compliant release form (See Requirements for Release of Information Forms in Additional Resources) , and that it maintains records for the appropriate number of years, among many other things. Providers subject to HIPAA should consult their legal counsel regarding the many administrative requirements in HIPAA. <h4>What is the HIPAA/CMIA confidentiality rule?</h4> Generally, health care providers cannot disclose information protected by HIPAA and without a signed authorization. 15 An authorization form must include specific elements to be valid under HIPAA and CMIA. (See Requirements for Release of Information Forms in Additional Resources. ) 16 HIPAA and California law also define who must sign the authorization. 17 <h5>Who signs an authorization to release health information under HIPAA and CMIA?</h5> A parent, guardian or another person with authority under the law to make health decisions for an unemancipated minor usually must sign authorizations to release the minor’s information. 18 However, if the minor consented or could have consented for the health care under California’s minor consent laws for the health care, the minor must sign the authorization. Some of California’s minor consent laws are highlighted in Covered Entities in Additional Resources. <h5>Real World Example</h5> Jake, 16, needs a general physical. He is authorized to consent to his own health care under California law because he is 15-years-old or older, not living with his parents, and managing his own financial affairs. Because he can consent to his own care, he can sign authorizations to release the related health information. (See California Minor Consent Laws in Additional Resources.) <h5>Do exceptions in HIPAA and CMIA allow release of information without written authorization?</h5> The default rule in HIPAA and CMIA is that release of protected health information requires a signed authorization; however, there are many exceptions to this rule. Exceptions in HIPAA and CMIA allow, and sometimes require, health care providers to share health and mental health information without the need of a signed release. A few examples of these exceptions include: Different conditions must be met before information may be shared under each exception. For example, the “treatment” exception under HIPAA and CMIA only allows a health provider to disclose information to other providers of health care, health care service plans, contractors, or other health care professionals or facilities and only for purposes of diagnosis or treatment of the patient. So, it is important to understand the law before relying on an exception to disclose protected health information. <h3>What is FERPA?</h3> The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects the privacy of students’ personal records held by “educational agencies or institutions” that receive federal funds under programs administered by the U.S. Secretary of Education. 29 <h4>What are the general requirements of FERPA?</h4> Generally, FERPA prohibits educational agencies from releasing any information in the education record unless they have written permission for the release. 42 In most cases, a parent 43 must sign that release. Requirements for a FERPA-compliant release can be found in Requirements for Release of Information Forms in Additional Resources. When students are eighteen years old or older, they sign their own release forms. FERPA also requires educational agencies to allow parents to access their minor children’s education records. <h4>What information does FERPA protect?</h4> FERPA controls disclosure of recorded information maintained in the “education record.” “Education records” are defined as records, files, documents, or other materials that contain information directly related to a student and are maintained by an educational agency or institution, or a person acting for such agency or institution. 32 “Information directly related to a student” means any information “that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community . . . to identify the student with reasonable certainty.” 33 FERPA does not apply to all information at a school exchanged by school staff. For example, communications that are not recorded in any form, such as the contents of a conversation between a teacher and student in a hallway, are not part of the education record and are not subject to FERPA. There also are several types of records that are exempted from FERPA. For purposes of school based health care, the most relevant exemptions include: <h5>Real World Example</h5> A teacher personally witnesses an incident, such as one student bullying another. Can the teacher call the victim’s parents and tell them what she observed and who she saw bullying their child? Yes. This is because FERPA prohibits the improper disclosure of information derived from education records. Therefore, information that is based on observation or hearsay and not specifically contained in education records would not be protected from disclosures under FERPA. Source: U.S. Department of Education’s Family Policy Compliance Office. <h4>How does FERPA intersect with California Law?</h4> Records that are kept in the sole possession of the maker, are used only as a personal memory aid, and are not accessible or revealed to any other person except a temporary substitute for the maker of the record 34 Treatment records of a student 18 and older when used only in connection with treatment and not made available to anyone other than those providing treatment 35 California has state laws that protect the confidentiality of information held by schools. 49 For the most part, the rules and exceptions in California law parallel those found in FERPA. 50 To the extent that provisions of FERPA conflict with state law or regulation, FERPA usually preempts state law. If an educational agency believes there is an actual conflict between obligations under state law and its ability to comply with FERPA, the educational agency must notify the U.S. Department of Education’s Family Policy Compliance Office. 51 If a school employee believes there may be a conflict between FERPA and California law, they should contact their school district legal counsel. <h4>What administrative requirements must a health provider with records subject to FERPA satisfy?</h4> If a school based health program has records subject to FERPA, it must meet all the administrative requirements in FERPA. Among other things, this includes: It includes other considerations as well. The National Forum on Education Statistics has a guide to implementing FERPA. 55 Requirements for a compliant release form can be found in Requirements for Release of Information Forms in Additional Resources, and the U.S. Department of Education provides several model notices for educational agencies. 56 <h3>FAQs</h3> <h4>HIPAA</h4> HIPAA defines “covered entity” as health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers who transmit health information in electronic form related to certain types of transactions. 2 “Health care providers” who “transmit health information in electronic form” are “covered entities” and must comply with HIPAA. “Health care providers” are defined to include both individual providers such as physicians, clinical social workers, and other medical and mental health practitioners, as well as hospitals, clinics and other organizations. 3 Health care providers are only subject to HIPAA, however, if they transmit health information regarding certain types of health transactions electronically. The transactions that will make HIPAA applicable include any of the following when done electronically: submitting claims to health insurers, making benefit and coverage inquiries to insurers, making inquiries about submitted claims, and sending health care authorization requests, among others. 4 The fact that a school based program or provider may not use electronic records onsite does not automatically mean it is exempt from HIPAA. Providers may be transmitting electronic health information in another way, for example, by using a billing service that does. That said, there will be providers who are not subject to HIPAA because they do not transmit health information in electronic form related  to covered transactions. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services offers a “Covered Entity Chart” that a provider can use to determine whether the provider is subject to HIPAA. 5 (See Covered Entities for further information.) Even if a health provider meets the definition of “covered entity,” some of its records may be subject to FERPA instead of HIPAA when working at or with a school. (See HIPAA, FERPA, Both or Neither? A Flowchart for Decision-Making .) Most covered entities work with other organizations and individuals in order to provide health care. Examples include attorneys, data processors, and accountants. A “business associate” is an individual  or  organization that receives, creates, maintains, or transmits “protected health information” as part of certain types of work it does on behalf of a covered entity. The type of work must be directly related to activities the covered entity does that are regulated by HIPAA, such as claims processing or billing, or services that support that work such as legal, actuarial, transcription, accounting, consulting, management, accreditation, or financial services. 6 (See endnote 6 for more examples.) In most cases, the covered entity must enter into a business associate contract with this individual or organization in order to share protected health information. Indirectly, yes. A covered entity cannot share information with a business associate unless the covered entity has received written assurances from the business associate that the business associate will protect “protected health information” in compliance with HIPAA. HIPAA outlines what this written agreement must include before a covered entity may share health information with the business associate. These contracts cannot obligate a business associate to do something that otherwise conflicts with other laws, however, such as FERPA. Providers always should consult legal counsel regarding such contracts and whether an organization qualifies as a “business associate” in the first place. 7 <h4>FERPA</h4> “Educational agencies or institutions” are defined as institutions that provide direct instruction to students, such as schools; as well as educational agencies that direct or control schools, including school districts and state education departments. 30 Almost all public schools and public school districts receive some form of federal education funding and must comply with FERPA. Organizations and individuals that contract with or consult for an educational agency also may be subject to FERPA if certain conditions are met. 31 These conditions are discussed later on in greater detail later on. FERPA contains exceptions that allow agencies and schools to disclose information absent a written release in some circumstances. For example, schools may share “directory information” 44 about students with the public generally if the school and district have given public notice to parents about the types of information the school and district consider directory information, the parents’ right to refuse directory disclosures, and how long parents have to inform the school or district about their intent to opt out. 45 Another exception allows school staff to share information with “school  officials” 46 in the same educational agency who have a “legitimate educational interest” in the information. 47 This exception is further discussed in the answer to “Are treatment or health records in an education file treated differently than other types of information in the file?” above . Certain policies must be in place at the district level in order to implement both of these exceptions. Additional exceptions also exist, including exceptions that allow sharing information in emergency situations with contractors, and for school transfers, among others. 48 The emergency exception is discussed further in School Nurses Frequently Asked Questions in the answer to “ Does FERPA still apply if a school nurse is hired with funds from an agency not subject to FERPA such as a foundation or the Department of Health?”. California law says  that “information of a personal nature” 52 disclosed by a student 12 and older, or the student’s parents, to a school counselor 53 as part of receiving “educational counseling” 54 (as defined in state law) does not become part of the pupil record, and access to that information is very limited. 55 (See endnote for limitations.) The statute goes on to say that “[i]t is the intent of the Legislature that counselors use the privilege of confidentiality under this section to assist the pupil whenever possible to communicate more effectively with parents, school staff, and others.” Before relying on this rule, it is critical to discuss this law with school district legal counsel to understand its scope and any possible conflicts with FERPA. Student health records maintained by a school or school employees, such as treatment records, IEP assessments, or immunization documents, are part of the education file in almost all cases .37 FERPA does not treat health and mental health records in a minor’s education file differently than it does any other information, such as grades or demographic information in the file. 38 That said, FERPA generally limits access to all student records, and for example, only school staff with a “legitimate educational interest” in the information should be able to access it. FERPA requires schools to include in their annual notices to parents a statement indicating whether the school has a policy of disclosing information from the education file to school officials, and, if so, which parties are considered school officials for this purpose and what the school considers to be a “legitimate educational interest.” 39 There is one small exception. Some treatment records are not part of the “education record.” Records of treatment provided students who are 18 and older, created by a medical provider, only used for treatment purposes and not shared with others are not subject to FERPA. This is a very limited exception, however. These records become a part of the education file and are subject to FERPA as soon as the records are used for anything beyond treatment or shared with anyone other than providers — for example, disclosed to the parent or shared to obtain reimbursement for the care. Records of a law enforcement unit mean those records, files, documents, and other materials that are (i) Created by a law enforcement unit; (ii) Created for a law enforcement purpose; and (iii) Maintained by the law enforcement unit. 40 Law enforcement unit records are not considered part of the “education record” and are not subject to FERPA. The law enforcement unit of a school is any individual, office, department, division, or other component of an educational agency or institution, such as a unit of commissioned police officers or non-commissioned security guards, that  is  officially authorized or designated by that agency or institution to: For information on how and when schools can disclose information to law enforcement and the law enforcement unit at a school, please consult school district counsel. The U.S. Department of Education provides this guidance: “ ‘Law enforcement unit records’ (i.e., records created by the law enforcement unit, created for a law enforcement purpose, and maintained by the law enforcement unit) are not ‘education records’ subject to the privacy protections of FERPA. As such, the law enforcement unit may refuse to provide a parent or eligible student with an opportunity to inspect and review law enforcement unit records, and it may disclose law enforcement unit records to third parties without the parent or eligible student’s prior written consent. However, education records, or personally identifiable information from education records, which the school shares with the law enforcement unit, do not lose their protected status as education records just because they are shared with the law enforcement unit.” Source: U.S. Dept. of Education, “ Are law enforcement records considered education records ?” available at https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/faq/are-law-enforcement-records-considered-education-records Sole possession records are records that are kept in the sole possession of the maker, are used only as a personal memory aid, and are not accessible or revealed to any other person except a temporary substitute. Sole possession records are not considered part of the education record and are not subject to FERPA. These records become a part of the education file and are subject to FERPA, however, as soon as they are shared with anyone other than a temporary substitute for the maker. The U.S. Department of Education provides this guidance: “Generally sole possession records are of the nature to serve as a ‘memory jogger’ for the creator of the record. For example, if a school official has taken notes regarding telephone or face to face conversations, such notes could be sole possession records depending on the nature and content of the notes.” The DOE also cautions in its guidance: “Once the contents or information recorded in sole possession records is disclosed to any party other than a temporary substitute for the maker of the records, those records become education records subject to FERPA.” Source: U.S. Dept. of Education, “ What records are exempted from FERPA? ” available at: https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/faq/what-records-are-exempted-ferpa",

      "title": "Student Mental Health Implementation Guide",
      "link": "https://dev-chsa-ai.pantheonsite.io/resource/student-mental-health-implementation-guide/",
      "content": "<h3>Introduction</h3> This guide is intended to support local education agencies (LEAs) and county behavioral health departments (BHDs) as they partner to deliver comprehensive, high-quality school mental health services for California students. These collaborative efforts can be challenging, and although helpful information and tools exist, they are spread out in many different places. The goal of this resource is to create a library of accessible tools organized around critical topics and challenges. Each section includes an overview of the topic and a collection of related resources. A glossary below is included for your convenience. <h3>Definition of Common Terms & Acronyms</h3> AB 114, Special Education Transition Signed in 2011, this law ended the state mandate on county mental health agencies to provide mental health services to students with disabilities. After the passage of AB 114, school districts are solely responsible for ensuring that students with disabilities receive special education and related services, including some services previously arranged for or provided by county mental health agencies. In some cases, school districts still contract with counties, or county-contracted providers, to provide mental health services to special education students. CMAA = County Medicaid Administrative Activities Participating local governmental agencies are eligible to receive Federal reimbursement for the cost of performing administrative activities that directly support efforts to identify and enroll potentially eligible individuals into Medi-Cal, and to remove barriers to Medi-Cal services. Eligible activities include outreach to the general population and high-risk populations, facilitating Medi-Cal applications, contracting for Medi-Cal services, and program planning and policy development. CYBHI = Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative Five-year, multi-billion dollar state initiative launched in 2021 to create a more integrated, youth-centered system of support that allows youth to find mental health and substance use needs where, when and in the way they need it. CYBHI is comprised of over 20 workstreams, and includes programs focused on California’s behavioral health workforce, ecosystem infrastructure, health coverage, and public awareness. EPSDT = Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment An enhanced Medicaid benefit that requires states to screen for and provide services necessary to ameliorate physical and mental health conditions for all persons under age 21 who are eligible. Under EPSDT, young people who qualify for full scope Medi-Cal (or Medicaid) with mental health conditions that meet medical necessity are entitled to services including, but not limited to, the following: mental health assessment, collateral contacts, therapy, rehabilitation, mental health services, medication support services, day rehabilitation, day treatment intensive, crisis intervention/stabilization, targeted case management, and therapeutic behavioral services. EPSDT Specialty Mental Health Refers to the “moderate to severe” Medi-Cal mental health benefits that county behavioral health agencies are responsible. Medi-Cal Managed Care Organizations (MCOs, i.e. health plans) are largely responsible for the rest of the EPSDT benefit for beneficiaries under age 21. ERMHS = Educationally Related Mental Health Services These services are provided when special education students have significant social, emotional and/or behavioral needs that impede their ability to benefit from their special education services, supports, and placement. Services must be included in the Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) and can include individual counseling, parent counseling, social work services, psychological services, and residential treatment. IEP = Individualized Education Plan This is a plan or program developed to ensure that a child with an identified disability who is attending an elementary or secondary educational institution receives specialized instruction and related services. ISF = Interconnected Systems Framework A structure and process to integrate Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) and School Mental Health within school systems. The goal is to blend resources, training, systems, data, and practices in order to improve outcomes for all children and youth. LCAP = Local Control Accountability Plan A tool for local educational agencies (LEAs) to set goals, plan actions, and leverage resources to meet those goals to improve student outcomes. The plan is aligned with state funding that LEAs receive to achieve those goals and support the overall functioning of the LEA. LEA = Local Education Agency A local entity involved in education including but not limited to school districts, county offices of education, direct-funded charter schools, and special education local plan area (SELPA). MHSA = Mental Health Services Act Created in 2004 with the passage of Proposition 63, which levied a 1 percent tax on personal income above $1 million. MHSA provides the state’s second largest public funding stream for mental health services, after Medi-Cal. MHSA programs and services are intended to enhance, rather than replace, existing programs. A majority of MHSA funding goes to counties and counties are required to submit three-year program and expenditure plans and annual updates. MHSSA = Mental Health Student Services Act Funded by the Mental Health Services Act, MHSSA provides grants for partnerships between county mental health agencies and local education agencies to deliver school-based mental health services to young people and their families. MOU = Memorandum of Understanding An agreement between two parties that is not legally binding, but which outlines the responsibilities of each of the parties to the agreement. These agreements may describe the relationship between counties, LEAs, and community provider(s) and outline the responsibilities and expectations of partnerships between the various entities. MTSS = Multi-Tiered System of Support An integrated, comprehensive framework that focuses on Common Core State Standards, core instruction, differentiated learning, student-centered learning, individualized student needs, and the alignment of systems necessary for all students’ academic, behavioral, and social success. PEI = Prevention and Early Intervention One of five categories of expenditures in MHSA. This category is intended to fund programs and services that intervene early prior to the development of serious mental health issues and catch mental health issues in their earliest stages to prevent long-term suffering.  PEI programs emphasize strategies to reduce negative outcomes that may result from untreated mental illness: suicide, incarcerations, school failure or dropout, unemployment, prolonged suffering, homelessness, and removal of children from their homes. PBIS = Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports A framework for enhancing the adoption and implementation of a continuum of evidence-based interventions to achieve academically and behaviorally important outcomes for all students. As a “framework,” the emphasis is on a process or approach, rather than a curriculum, intervention, or practice. The “continuum” notion emphasizes how evidence- or research-based behavioral practices are organized within a multi-tiered system of support. SELPA = Special Education Local Plan Area Consortiums in geographical regions with sufficient size and scope to provide for all special education service needs of children residing within the region boundaries. Each region develops a local plan describing how it would provide special education services. SELPAs vary in size: some serve just one school district, some serve multiple school districts, some serve an entire county. SBHIP = Student Behavioral Health Incentive Program A workstream of CYBHI, SBHIP was launched in CY 2022 and funding concludes in December 2024. SBHIP provides financial incentives to increase coordination among Medi-Cal managed care plans and local education agencies to improve access to and delivery of mental health services. <h4>This Guide Created in Partnership With</h4>",

          "content": "One of the chief barriers to creating comprehensive systems of school-based mental health services is identifying funding streams that support interventions throughout the three tiers of intervention – from school-wide support to intensive treatment services. After time-limited grants help build out a system, what resources are available to sustain the services and initiative? Schools and community providers do not have the resources to sustain school mental health services on their own. No single entity (school, or community, or county) can provide the whole range of comprehensive services, for all students. Trust, partnerships, coordination, and community buy-in will help entities bring together resources to build out a comprehensive system of services. Also, there is not a national or state model for how to fund these services. While available funding is largely federal and state, many decisions about how to use funding and what services to prioritize happen at the local level. So, there may be examples of how different counties and school districts across California sustain mental health services, however there is not one “best” way to sustain these services. The resources in this section will help you (1) learn about the funding streams that are available to sustain school mental health services . While they will not tell you exactly how you should use these, the resources will help you develop a general understanding of what funding streams are available and what partnerships are necessary to leverage that funding for school-based services. And (2) learn about what others have done to sustain school mental health programs . County demographics, strengths, and challenges vary considerably. What works in one place may not work in another (i.e. heavily leveraging Medi-Cal reimbursement). However, there are innovative and varying sustainability strategies to garner inspiration from. Other overall recommendations to consider while identifying your sustainability plan: If you are benefiting from a grant to build out your school mental health initiative, use that time-limited grant to create a “runway” to sustainability . Use grant funding to support your services and staff as you identify and address billing and reimbursement challenges and build outcomes of interest that may bring in new partners and/or additional funding. <h3>Resources</h3>",

In this section, you will find a breakdown of what types of providers can be employed to provide different services and the requirements for different types of credentials, as well as sample job descriptions and training calendars. Some considerations to take into account when considering what type of staffing structure would be the best fit include: A comprehensive school mental health program that is inclusive of the three tiers of the MTSS framework can and should include non-clinical staff and/or partners who can support many of the activities of mental health services that fall into Tier 1 and Tier 2. More details of non-clinical roles that you can consider, including Certified Wellness Coaches, Community Health Workers, and Peer Support Specialists can be found here . The agency taking the role of hiring the school mental health staff will need to develop a training plan that considers how to train the staff in ways that encompass services across the three tiers of intervention as well as how school mental health staff integrate into the school culture and climate. Training considerations should also include how the school mental health staff can support education staff wellness, social and emotional literacy, and healing centered practices. There also needs to be considerations for where the services will take place and what type of facilities and space are needed. Some Tier 2 and 3 mental health interventions that take place in the school need confidential spaces for services and record keeping. The type of agency providing the service will help shape factors to consider. For Medi-Cal reimbursement, you may need to consider licensing and certification requirements for sites or facilities. In this section there is a link to a guide on facility and certification requirements in order to provide Medi-Cal eligible services. <h3>Resources</h3>",

          "content": "Collaboration and coordination among community partners in the education and mental health field are necessary to increase student mental health. In order for efforts to be most effective, there needs to be collaboration and buy-in at every level of leadership. The leadership between education and mental health entities need to coordinate efforts and work together from the State leadership, to the county and district leadership, to the school site and local mental health providers. This coordination is challenging work for many reasons as leadership, staff, and providers can often have different points of view, different priorities and even use different language. This makes commitment to working together and across the systems so important and requires patience, flexibility and creativity. In efforts to support student mental health, collaboration between student supports, including partner agencies, and school administration and staff is vital. Included in this section are resources to support efforts of coordination at different levels of leadership. There are multiple “layers” of coordination to consider: at the school site level responding directly to student needs to regional or county levels where systemic issues and collective responses can be addressed and discussed. Building a team to coordinate supports and referrals is a significant component of successful school mental health partnerships. Coordination teams come in many different shapes, sizes, and names. One approach for coordinating and working together is through a site-based Coordination of Services Team (COST) (see guide and resources included below). Regardless of what the coordination process is called, there are several important components: Based on your needs assessment, an overall understanding of the entire continuum of services available in the system of care. It is important that various coordination teams, to the best of their ability, understand who provides what services in the system of care, how students are referred to services, and eligibility determinations. A universal referral form that allows students, parents, and all staff to refer students when there is indication support could be beneficial. Examples of COST referral forms are also included. The referral form ensures that students have access to available services. Regular meetings among support staff and school staff to discuss student referrals and create plans of support at the school site level. Regular meetings ensure that staff have the opportunity to share data (while ensuring confidentiality) and report back on student outcomes, reflect on trends and needs that are coming up across the school and ways to increase school wide efforts. For example, a high number of referrals for freshman girls experiencing anxiety during the first six months of school could lead to creating support groups and curriculum implemented across a class that all freshmen are taking. Screening students school-wide for mental health risks enables students to access early intervention and allows schools to notice trends and create supports tailored to their communities. Coordination between mental health agencies and the school personnel is required for quality and effective screening and planning for meeting students’ needs. See more information about School-wide screening protocols, as well as specific considerations about screening for trauma in the resources below. Tracking student data and outcomes of referrals and services ensures that the needs of the students are being met as well as identifying early warning indicators that will help provide early intervention for often overlooked students. Some school sites have been able to implement the COST referral form and services to students’ educational accounts through the school so that teachers and all staff can access real time updates on what is working to help the student. One of the biggest challenges in coordinating student mental health programs and services arises around issues of confidentiality, protected health and student information, and data sharing ; simply put, there are federal and state laws that protect student and patient information. We have included a comprehensive guide to help partners understand these laws and identify practices to facilitate coordination and protect student information. <h3>Resources</h3>",

          "content": "The needs assessment process (and it is a process, not a single activity) will help school, county, health, and community partners to decide where to start. Whether you and your partners work in large or small counties, whether you start from scratch or think about how to expand an existing initiative, whether you consider where to start in a whole county or one school district: creating a definition of need and goals will help you identify where to start, assess your impact, and decide what to do next once there is some momentum. Some considerations when starting the assessment process: The Student Behavioral Health Incentive Program is a state-wide project with the goal of improving coordination of child and adolescent behavioral health services for those enrolled in Medi-Cal through increased communication with schools, school-affiliated programs, managed care providers, counties and mental health providers. A key element of the program includes 58 needs assessments that can serve as a source of youth behavioral health data in each county. Components of the needs assessment include community partner meetings to gain diverse perspectives, data collection strategies engaging various groups, and an assessment template detailing specific actions per LEA. The assessment uncovers prevalent behavioral health needs, proposes short/long-term actions, and identifies service delivery gaps, population-specific disparities, and referral process barriers. It maps existing resources, budgets, program enhancements, and strategies for promoting services to students, staff, and parents. Lastly, it outlines the closed-loop referral process for internal and external behavioral health referrals within each LEA, emphasizing coordination and monitoring of student support services. <h4>According to the Youth Engagement researchers at the Search Institute:</h4> In order for youth involvement to be successful, it should engage them in meaningful decision-making. Young people involved in decision-making grow developmentally and academically. Research shows that youth engagement builds skills such as leadership and public speaking, increases self-esteem, enhances identity development, and improves academic achievement. Youth develop skills that help them become healthy, confident, well- rounded community leaders. They become “experts,” capable of influencing both their peers and adults as well as being a voice for positive change.

Youth engagement can help ensure that the services provided are those of greatest need to youth, are developmentally and culturally appropriate, and are accessible to youth. <h4>According to the Youth Engagement researchers at the Search Institute:</h4> In order for youth involvement to be successful, it should engage them in meaningful decision-making. Young people involved in decision-making grow developmentally and academically. Research shows that youth engagement builds skills such as leadership and public speaking, increases self-esteem, enhances identity development, and improves academic achievement. Youth develop skills that help them become healthy, confident, well- rounded community leaders. They become “experts,” capable of influencing both their peers and adults as well as being a voice for positive change.

          "content": "It is critical to address the systemic racism that students, families, and communities experience. School mental health sits between two structures and systems – education and health care, particularly mental health care – that have deep histories in racist practices and structural biases. These biases persist today, and because of this, each action or decision made must be actively anti-racist in order for our initiative to achieve equity. While this section serves to highlight its importance independently, using an anti-racist and equity lens is integral and needs to be woven into every aspect of implementing school mental health. Addressing equity and creating anti-racist schools and school-based services is deep, challenging, and ongoing work. This is not one step or one section in the process of building school mental health programs and services. These are values, practices, critical conversations, and lifelong learning and humility that must be knitted throughout our school mental health partnerships, planning, and implementation. Most importantly, consideration must be given to integrate this hard work from the beginning and on an ongoing basis. In this guide, there are a number of resources that explore anti-racist and structural biases in mental health delivery, organizations broadly, and school mental health systems specifically. As leaders in regional, county, or local organizations and agencies interested in building school mental health systems and programs, please consider these questions as you explore the ongoing work of dismantling biases, racism, and white supremacy in the initiatives you create: <h4>Resources</h4>",

          "content": "School mental health involves addressing the mental health needs of students within an educational setting. It encompasses a holistic approach that promotes emotional well-being, psychological resilience, and the development of coping skills. By actively addressing the mental health needs of students, schools contribute to creating a positive and supportive learning environment. This, in turn, enhances students’ overall academic performance, social interactions, and long-term success. A focus on school mental health not only benefits individual students but also fosters a healthier and more inclusive school community. School mental health is closely aligned with ongoing school and health care initiatives across the state of California, including: While this guide curates tools for building school mental health services and programs, none of these efforts should happen in isolation from other school and county initiatives. Implementing School Mental Health involves addressing the school environment and policies shaping the daily experiences of staff and students. It goes beyond increasing access to specific interventions, focusing on the entire school community and climate. These initiatives aim to cultivate positive school climates and cultures through supportive student and staff relationships, complemented by more targeted services for students requiring intensive support, thus forming a comprehensive approach to enhancing student mental health. A note about language: we try to use the terminology, “mental health,” consistently throughout this guide to cover the continuum of school-based services, from prevention to treatment, that address a student’s sense of wellbeing. However, some linked resources use the terminology, “behavioral health.” The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) defines behavioral health as “the promotion of mental health, resilience, and wellbeing; and the treatment of mental and substance use disorders.” Some community members have experienced the term “behavioral” as stigmatizing, ignoring the impact of racism and poverty on children’s health. The California Children’s Partnership suggests terminology such as “social, emotional, and mental health” to be more inclusive of the challenges facing children and youth. <h4>Related Resources</h4>",
