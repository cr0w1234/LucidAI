The Professional Quality of Life Measure (Pro-QOL) is a free resource developed by researchers, educators, and clinicians. It is used to take inventory of one’s compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary/vicarious trauma. Distribute a copy of Pro-QOL 5, Self-Score to all participants. Instruct participants to spend the next 7-8 minutes completing the self-assessment to take inventory on the ways exposure to secondary trauma is currently affecting them. Taking inventory in this way can help in creating a plan for healing and care that specifically addresses the impact. If you will be following this session with Vicarious Trauma Part II, request participants bring their ProQOL to the next session. Assure participants that the next session will be entirely focused on responding to †he question of “now what?” and explore a variety of strategies for responding to vicarious trauma both individually and collectively. If you are unable to provide Vicarious Trauma Part II as follow-up to this session, encourage participants to utilize the results from the Pro-QOL to engage in a practice of setting intentional goals for self and community care.

Attendees included a wide range of school health professionals (e.g., school nurses, mental health providers, clinicians, administrators) who self-selected into the conference session. Most of these participants were not currently implementing ACE screening in a clinical setting. The listening sessions gathered insights from school health staff on their awareness of the ACEs Aware Initiative; current practices, barriers and facilitators around trauma-informed care, ACE and trauma screening, and care coordination; the impact of COVID-19 on schools and SBHCs; and questions and technical assistance needs related to the implementation of ACE screening and trauma-informed care. Listening sessions notes were coded by key themes. Virtual Professional Learning Collaborative: Through our Provider Engagement Peer-to-Peer grant, we hosted a virtual professional learning collaborative with nine school-based health providers (including two physicians, four nurse practitioners, one school counselor, one lead school nurse, one clinical therapist) and two public health researchers from our team. Participants were eligible to participate in the collaborative if they were currently implementing or planning to implement ACE screening in a SBHC setting and could commit to attending all six virtual sessions. Selected applicants represented a diversity of providers based on location (California region, urbanicity, school size), youth demographics (grade level, race/ethnicity, socio-economic status), and provider experience. Participants represented six counties across California serving rural and urban middle and high schools. Two participants represented SBHCs that had a sustained clinical practice of ACE screening; one participant recently started ACE screening in their SBHC, and the remaining participants were planning to implement ACE screening. The collaborative met monthly from November 2020 through April 2021. Sessions included a 50-minute presentation and discussion on a focal topic facilitated by our project team followed by a 30-minute case study presented by a learning collaborative participant.

There are a number of existing agencies that provide telehealth primary care services or other telehealth services. Hazel Health specifically focuses on providing this care in school settings. One school district in Southern California contracts with Hazel Health to deliver physical health services via telehealth for students as part of its solution to address student health and wellness. Hazel Health provided the district with equipment such as a locked medication cart and iPad rolling cart and a series of trainings for health aides and school nurses to establish a protocol and workflow. They targeted students who experienced chronic absenteeism and students who needed additional care or coverage. The cost to the district is based on the total number of enrolled students and the district used its Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) and Learning Communities for Student Success (LCSSP) grant funding to support its subscription. Utilization of this program has been lower than anticipated underscoring the importance/challenge of establishing trust and confidence with a purely telehealth provider. These arrangements are relatively simple for school districts because of their “plug-and-play” nature but may require the school district to cover the full costs of the program, as opposed to generating reimbursement through Medi-Cal or other sources.

This year’s conference took place in Ontario at the Inland Empire Health Plan (IEHP) headquarters, with the theme of Empowering Youth Driven Waves of Change . Students led and participated in workshops and activities based around topics such as substance use prevention, peer mentoring, improving community health, and helping youth develop leadership skills. There were 11 youth-led workshops targeting topics such as fostering healthy relationships, youth advocacy, and school wellness centers. Alongside the workshops were creative and fun youth-led activities such as “get to know each other Bingo” and group activities such as guessing objects depicted in close-up photos. Students enjoyed a photobooth as well as numerous “brain breaks” that fostered a fun and creative outlet for youth to relax and bond. These youth-only rooms included bouquet-making, collaging, bracelet-making, and many more opportunities for the attendees to connect with one another and try new things. The conference cultivated a space where young people could come together to connect with one another in a youth-centered space. CSHA’s Youth Board , which consists of 9 young adults from across California, worked together to envision a youth-centered safe space. Two youth board members , Rehma Shahid and Christian Lizaso, emceed the event.

They may withdraw, isolate, or avoid meaningful activities.

{"content_chunk": "LEAs and schools can approach school health partnerships in a number of ways. At one extreme, an LEA can operate all health services independently, accessing no partners and delivering all the school health services its students need through its own funding and personnel. This is relatively unusual, but it does allow the LEA the most control over the services and related student information. The advantage of this arrangement is that the school district does not need to coordinate with outside entities, avoiding some of the tricky issues that arise with inter-agency and especially inter-sector collaboration. It retains full control and can share information easily across providers, with all documentation of student strengths, needs and services within the educational record. On the other hand, this model has major disadvantages: it does not leverage the unique strengths and assets of local partners that may be well suited to providing student health services and have funding and resources to cover some or all of the costs. Schools can wisely take advantage of these partners, as shown in next sections, to extend the services available to students in support of their health, well-being, and educational success. At the other extreme end of the continuum is an LEA that has decided to contract or turn over all school health services to an outside health agency or agencies. This LEA may reduce its operational burden and financial obligation, take advantage of health partners, and also lose some measure of direct control. This can occur if a school district is under state oversight or other distress, and must focus exclusively on education. Other times it is because a strong public health department offers an entire package at low or no cost to the district. Of course, even in these cases, health partners should collaborate closely with schools, as described in the next section of this guide. In reality, most schools and school districts operate between these two polar extremes, offering school health programs with select partners and maintaining some involvement and programmatic oversight. For example, most LEAs engage outside providers for at least some of the Educationally Related Mental Health Services. Partner-delivered services might be provided all year or on a seasonal schedule at key times - e.g., physical exams before the school year starts, scoliosis screenings, or crisis interventions following major school incidents.
