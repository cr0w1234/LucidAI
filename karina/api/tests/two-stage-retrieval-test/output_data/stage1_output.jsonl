On campuses with SBHCs, about 70% of students receive free or reduced price meals. Students in communities that benefit from school-based health and wellness centers are less likely to have health insurance or access to health and mental health services that address these risk factors. Without access to high-quality health services, childhood risk factors are more likely to be translated into higher rates of diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and other chronic illnesses in adulthood as well as more struggles with academic success. Of California’s 400 school-based health and wellness centers: Most of California’s SBHCs are physically located right on campus within a main building or in a portable. In some areas, health services are provided by mobile medical or dental vans, and in other areas, “school-linked” health centers are off campus and have formal operating agreements with schools. School-based health centers and wellness centers (SBHCs/WCs) are spread from Del Norte to San Diego County with large concentrations in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area.

{"page_id": 2866, "title": "School Climate", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/school-climate/", "content": "School-based health centers and wellness centers (SBHC/WC) and other school health professionals can play an important role in enhancing school climate, particularly in improving student behavior and rethinking disciplinary approaches. Many schools have begun to move away from zero-tolerance disciplinary policies and to acknowledge the social, emotional, and physical factors that shape student behavior. Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) is an increasingly popular approach. It engages all stakeholders—including teachers, administrators, service providers, and families—in actively teaching and reinforcing expected behavior. PBIS prompts schools to identify and meet student needs that manifest as inappropriate behavior, reducing serious problems and improving overall climate. Mental health specialists and other school health staff can be integral to the assessment process, through which the underlying causes of a student’s disruptive behavior are identified. SBHCs can also lead the implementation of alternative behavioral interventions, such as anger management sessions, leadership development programming, individual and group counseling sessions, and peer support groups. According to the Center for School, Health and Education at the American Public Health Association, SBHCs have a “natural role” and are a “powerful ally” in efforts to improve school climate. CSHA believes that schools can and should be safe, welcoming, and supportive environments for all students. CSHA supports advocacy efforts in California to eliminate police in schools. We also believe that school funds should go to student learning and health, and not police. To achieve this, we acknowledge that it may take school communities time to redefine school safety without relying on school police. This work does not happen overnight. However, important action is needed immediately to ensure schools are healthy and safe environments for all students…[ Read More ]” – CSHA’s Position on Police in Schools <h2>Police in Schools</h2> Black-led and youth-led community-based organizations have been advocating and organizing for police-free school campuses for years. School-based health centers and the young people they serve tell us that students need more supportive services – like primary care, behavioral health and restorative justice – instead of school police. The deaths of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and many other Black Americans brought systemic racism and police violence into sharper focus. At the California School-Based Health Alliance, our incredible Youth Board in 2020 strongly encouraged us in our role as advocates for student health to take a position against schools investing in police on campus. We have joined these brave leaders and partners by taking a position to support advocacy efforts in California to eliminate police in schools. We believe that school funds should go to student learning and health, and not police. <h2>Our Position on Police in Schools</h2> Instead of increasing school safety, research shows that the presence of school police officers has a harmful effect on all students of color and particularly Black students. SBHC/WCs and school health services play an important role in supporting positive school climates for all students, especially those that face the greatest health and education disparities. As an alternative to police, we believe that school investments should focus on practices and services that promote a positive school climate that protects every young person and their dignity. It also includes age-appropriate, non-punitive services that address student behaviors and underlying needs. Strong evidence indicates that non-punitive approaches are associated with high levels of academic achievement, healthy student development, and safe learning environments. We continue to support all schools as they strive to create environments where all students can thrive. <h2>Related Resources</h2> Swipe to see more <h3>Chronic Absenteeism</h3> <h4>Addressing the Health-Related Causes of Chronic Absenteeism: A Toolkit for Action</h4> <h3>School Discipline Reform</h3> <h4>School Discipline & Student Substance Use: A guide for school-based health providers</h4> <h4>Alternatives to Suspension: Student Tobacco and Substance Use</h4> <h2>Stay Up-to-Date on School-Based Health</h2> Sign up to receive our free newsletter and advocate for kids’ health.

{"page_id": 2957, "title": "SBIRT Quick Guide: Brief Interventions", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/sbirt-quick-guides/brief-interventions/", "content": "<h2>Why Adopt Brief Interventions for Substance Use?</h2> Brief interventions are structured conversations designed to address alcohol and/or drug use among youth who are using substances, but do not need specialty SUD treatment. They are intended to be used when a young person screens positive for substance use or the need to discuss substance use emerges some other way. The goal of brief interventions is to have a discussion aimed at reinforcing a youth’s self-determination to reduce their risky behavior. Brief interventions are designed to be delivered in non-SUD treatment settings such as SBHCs. <h2>Motivational interviewing: The best way to conduct brief interventions</h2> Motivational interviewing is a collaborative, client-centered counseling style that guides individuals to elicit and strengthen their motivation for change. 4 Rather than advising youth that they “should” or “need to” stop using alcohol or drugs, providers use motivational interviewing to have open conversations, using reflective listening skills and other conversational techniques to mobilize a young person’s own intrinsic values as motivation to change their substance use. Research shows that motivational interviewing is the most effective tool for achieving meaningful and lasting changes in substance use behavior within a relatively brief time period. 5-6 Using motivational interviewing, providers can help youth identify their own reasons to either reduce substance use or stop altogether, and collaboratively develop strategies to achieve behavior change goals. <h3>What are some techniques for brief interventions?</h3> The Brief Negotiated Interview (BNI) is a semi structured interview process based on motivational interviewing and can be completed in 5-15 minutes. “What’s a typical day like for you? What do you like to do? How does Vicodin fit in?” “What do you like less about Vicodin? Do you ever regret using Vicodin?” If they can’t think of any cons, explore problems mentioned on the CRAFFT, i.e.: “You said that you have gotten into trouble while using Vicodin. Tell me more about that.” “So on one hand you enjoy Vicodin because….and on the other hand it has caused these problems…” “We know that use of opioids by young people has some negative consequences. They can lead to short-term problems like impaired ability to learn, family relationship issues, and overdose & death, along with long-term consequences like collapsed veins, respiratory problems, and liver disease.” “Young people who use prescription opioids in their early teens are more likely to be using heroin when they graduate from high school. Because your brain is still developing, opioids can cause permanent changes in your brain and make you more vulnerable to addiction as an adult.” “What do you think about this information?” Use to determine how ready the young person is to make a change, how important making a change is to them, or how confident they are that they will be able to make the change “Why did you choose that number and not a lower number, like a 1 or a 2?” “That’s great, it means you’re ___% ready to make a change.” Reflect their response and say: “So it sounds like you have some reasons to make a change.” “What do you want your life to look like down the road?” (Probe for goals) “How does this change fit in with those goals?” “What might be some challenges in accomplishing your goal with regard to Vicodin?” “What’s something you have accomplished in the past that you felt proud of? Who or what helped you succeed in that How can you use that (person or method) to help you with the challenges of making this change now?” “If you make this change, how would things be better for you?” (If available, present list of local resources) “Which of these services, if any, are you interested in to help you with your goal?” “OK, here’s the action plan we’ve discussed. This is really an agreement between you and yourself.” “Thanks so much for coming in and talking with me today! I’d love to see you come back in X weeks.” FLO stands for Feedback, Listen & Understand, and Options Explored. It takes 15 minutes and condenses the main elements of brief interventions into three steps. The provider is listening for their reasons for using substances (trying to understand them), and their reasons for reducing or stopping. “What would be some of the good things about cutting down or stopping your use of Vicodin?” is a question that directly “pulls” for change talk. The provider can offer options if the youth has difficulty coming up with their own ideas. Try to provide concrete examples of things they can do to reduce their risk of harm, e.g., not drinking or cutting back on the number of drinks per day. Remember that youth have a choice. Doing nothing is also an option. The provider can also offer to check in frequently. Very often, attention paid to one’s behavior can be an intervention. <h3>What are best practices when implementing brief interventions?</h3> Frequently Asked Questions about Minor Consent for Substance Use Disorder Services in California has information on Family Code 6929. Brief interventions, in conjunction with screening, should begin at age 12. Youth should receive brief interventions whenever they screen positive for a substance use screening. The provider (medical, behavioral health, or health education) should conduct the brief intervention with the young person while they are in a private room. The provider should also summarize the brief intervention in their chart notes. The next step depends on the level of intervention that the young person needs: In either case, a follow-up appointment should be scheduled so the SBHC provider can check in with the young person and ensure they are receiving the care they need. Yes, Teen Intervene is an example of a brief intervention program that can be done in groups. Teen Intervene is designed for mild to moderate cases of substance use. <h3>What should I do now?</h3> <h2>Download a Printable Guide</h2> Facilitating Change for Excellence in SBIRT – Guidance on using SBIRT from the National Council for Behavioral Health, Improving Adolescent Health Adolescent Substance Use Screening Overview – Resources on screening for adolescent substance use from the Conrad N.

{"page_id": 2708, "title": "Section 4: Needs Assessment", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/student-mental-health-implementation-guide/section-4-needs-assessment/", "content": "The needs assessment process (and it is a process, not a single activity) will help school, county, health, and community partners to decide where to start. Whether you and your partners work in large or small counties, whether you start from scratch or think about how to expand an existing initiative, whether you consider where to start in a whole county or one school district: creating a definition of need and goals will help you identify where to start, assess your impact, and decide what to do next once there is some momentum. Some considerations when starting the assessment process: The Student Behavioral Health Incentive Program is a state-wide project with the goal of improving coordination of child and adolescent behavioral health services for those enrolled in Medi-Cal through increased communication with schools, school-affiliated programs, managed care providers, counties and mental health providers. A key element of the program includes 58 needs assessments that can serve as a source of youth behavioral health data in each county. Components of the needs assessment include community partner meetings to gain diverse perspectives, data collection strategies engaging various groups, and an assessment template detailing specific actions per LEA. The assessment uncovers prevalent behavioral health needs, proposes short/long-term actions, and identifies service delivery gaps, population-specific disparities, and referral process barriers. It maps existing resources, budgets, program enhancements, and strategies for promoting services to students, staff, and parents. Lastly, it outlines the closed-loop referral process for internal and external behavioral health referrals within each LEA, emphasizing coordination and monitoring of student support services. <h4>According to the Youth Engagement researchers at the Search Institute:</h4> In order for youth involvement to be successful, it should engage them in meaningful decision-making. Young people involved in decision-making grow developmentally and academically. Research shows that youth engagement builds skills such as leadership and public speaking, increases self-esteem, enhances identity development, and improves academic achievement. Youth develop skills that help them become healthy, confident, well- rounded community leaders. They become “experts,” capable of influencing both their peers and adults as well as being a voice for positive change. Finally, youth who are involved in directing their school’s mental health services often develop positive, nurturing connections with caring adults – relationships that are invaluable to their development and help deepen their connection to school and work. Many examples of different youth engagement models in school health are included in the resources below. <h3>Resources</h3>", "modified": "2025-08-20T03:08:03", "slug": "section-4-needs-assessment", "status": "publish", "excerpt": "The needs assessment process (and it is a process, not a single activity) will help school, county, health, and community partners to decide where to start.

When identifying substance use for Native American youth it is important to remember: <h1>SUD Risk & Protective Factors</h1> It is important to identify both risk and protective factors because they represent opportunities for early intervention among Native American youth at greatest risk for adverse outcomes. Protective factors are conditions that protect against the incident of an adverse outcome (e.g., substance use) or promote the occurrence of a desirable outcome within a young person’s environment. Risk factors can be predictors of maladaptive behaviors or adverse conditions that exist at the structural, community, family, interpersonal, or individual levels. The existence of risk factors can increase the likelihood that an individual will acquire struggles with substance use compared to someone else without risk factors. Among Native American youth, historical trauma is a significant risk factor that pervades all levels of influence. Starting in the mid-1990s, the construct of historical trauma was presented into the behavioral health field to contextualize and explain elevated rates of psychological/social suffering and health inequalities among Native American populations. Native American historical trauma is distinguished by its emphasis on ancestral hardship that is intergenerationally transmitted in ways that negatively impact descendent well-being. Research shows some of the most significant social and intergenerational risk factors making Native American youth more vulnerable to SUDs are as follows: As a response to the impact of historical trauma and elevated mental health distress, Native American communities throughout California have developed a robust Native American behavioral health field including research on SUD protective factors. As part of the Native American driven behavioral health movement, Native researchers and practitioners stress the importance of taking a social-ecological perspective to promoting wellness and health for Native American youth. Below are important research informed protective factors for Native American youth from a social-ecological perspective (Nebelkopf & Penagos, 2005; Henson et al., 2017): <h1>Treatment Strategies: Tribal Best Practices</h1> In many Native American communities evidence-based substance use practices have been unsuccessful. A growing movement for substance use in Native American communities is termed Tribal Best Practices. These grassroot programs are common throughout Native American communities and often blend western science and theories with traditional knowledge and local Native American cultural values. Examples of Tribal Best Practices to reduce youth substance use include: Often, it is important for schools and SUD programs to work with local Native American community mental health workers. They often hold local understandings of history, culture, and traditional views of health and wellness and may reduce barriers to care while promoting tribal health, self-determination, and sovereignty. To see organizations who are doing Native American youth SUD work utilizing Native American community mental health workers, please see the Native American Technical Assistance Provider project . It is important to tailor substance use assessments and treatment strategies to Native American youth. We hope that this reference guide will help you think about possible next steps of how to implement some of these practices in your SBHC. We encourage you to partner with a local Native American organization so they can help you determine what might work best for the Native American youth in your area. <h2>Download a Printable Guide</h2> 1.

This year’s conference took place in Ontario at the Inland Empire Health Plan (IEHP) headquarters, with the theme of Empowering Youth Driven Waves of Change . Students led and participated in workshops and activities based around topics such as substance use prevention, peer mentoring, improving community health, and helping youth develop leadership skills. There were 11 youth-led workshops targeting topics such as fostering healthy relationships, youth advocacy, and school wellness centers. Alongside the workshops were creative and fun youth-led activities such as “get to know each other Bingo” and group activities such as guessing objects depicted in close-up photos. Students enjoyed a photobooth as well as numerous “brain breaks” that fostered a fun and creative outlet for youth to relax and bond. These youth-only rooms included bouquet-making, collaging, bracelet-making, and many more opportunities for the attendees to connect with one another and try new things. The conference cultivated a space where young people could come together to connect with one another in a youth-centered space. CSHA’s Youth Board , which consists of 9 young adults from across California, worked together to envision a youth-centered safe space. Two youth board members , Rehma Shahid and Christian Lizaso, emceed the event.

School-based health centers (SBHCs), defined as health clinics located on or near school campuses where children and youth can get immediate help for acute and chronic conditions as well as preventative care, are positioned to help create more equitable access to care for youth. Interest and momentum are building among local stakeholders in the Inland Empire region of California (Riverside and San Bernardino Counties) to develop new school-based health and wellness centers. The California School-Based Health Alliance’s Student Health Index — designed to identify opportunities to expand health care in schools — revealed that San Bernardino County has five of the top ten school districts with the highest ratio of high need schools to total schools. <h5>Purpose</h5> The purpose of the Inland Empire School-Based Health Centers Coalition (coalition) is to expand and support the SBHC movement, and to facilitate greater engagement, investment, and proliferation of school health services, all of which equate to greater access for youth. <h5>Goals</h5> <h3>Develop Partnerships</h3> <h3>Leverage Support</h3> <h3>Technical Assistance</h3> <h2>Steering Committee</h2> The development and maintenance of the coalition is supported by the California School-Based Health Alliance. We do this in partnership with representatives from partner health, education, and community based agencies from throughout the region. The steering committee provides leadership and guidance around the development and operations of the coalition, which includes planning convenings and serving as a channel of communication about school-based health care. <h6>School-Based Health Center Webinar Series</h6> The California School-Based Health Alliance has partnered with the San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools to present a series of webinars on bringing school-based health and wellness centers to schools. <h6>The School Health Connection Podcast</h6> The School Health Connection Podcast is your go-to source for insights and inspiration in creating healthier school environments.

She currently serves as the Wellness Counselor at Sierra High School (SHS) in San Bernardino, where her leadership has played a key role in the school being named one of America’s Healthiest Schools for two consecutive years and a member of the Recognized ASCA Model Program (RAMP) team. Driven by her personal journey, Yesenia is passionate about advocating for historically underserved youth, working as a catalyst for change. She partners with community-based organizations to provide students with access to evidence-based therapies and physical health services and has established a resource center that is open to the entire community. <h3>Developing & Implementing Universal Screening Efforts at a Wellness Center</h3> Schools are a critical provider of services to address the socio-emotional, behavioral health, and basic needs of students. Universal screening offers one avenue for systematically evaluating, identifying, and monitoring the needs of an entire student population. Acknowledging the reality of limited school-based resources for supporting ongoing screening efforts, this workshop will review the development and beta implementation of a novel digital system that enables identification of at-risk students via the administration of brief, psychometrically valid measures; expedited identification and referral to relevant services via automatic scoring and filtering; as well as ongoing progress tracking at individual and school-wide levels. Presenter: Shayna Greenberg , MA, PhD Student, Loma Linda University <h3>What Drives Student Health: Integrating Social Drivers of Health & Equity</h3> This workshop explores the impact of social drivers of health (SDOH) on student well-being and academic achievement, framed within the Whole Child, Whole School, Whole Community (WSCC) model. Participants will gain insights into how SDOH affects student well-being and academic success. The session will highlight the importance of integrating equity and justice into these discussions, emphasizing the establishment of student health centers as a key strategy. Presenter: Brianna Vasquez , MPH, CHES, Health Education Specialist II, San Bernardino County Department of Public Health <h3>Riverside County Office of Education’s CAREspace</h3> RCOE CAREspace provides free mental health and related services to students, families, staff, schools, and the community of Riverside County.

Presenter: Lexi Backstrom , EdD, EdS, MA, MBA, PPS, LMFT, LPCC, Administrator, Behavioral Health, Riverside County Office of Education <h3>California Children & Youth Behavioral Health Initiative (CYBHI) – Reimaging Our Ecosystem and Supports for Children</h3> Academic issues, poor attendance, behavior issues, health concerns, and poor social relations are a few of the adverse impacts for children experiencing mental health needs that go untreated. This has been a growing concern across California, leading to adverse child outcomes. To help address these needs, California Health and Human Services has made an unprecedented $4.7 billion investment to reimagine integrated ecosystems called the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative (CYBHI). In this presentation, you will hear how the CYBHI workstreams are supporting opportunities to improve outcomes for children. Presenter: Michael Lombardo , MA, Public Administration and Policy Advisor for Human Services and Education Agencies, MCL Collaboration <h3>Creative Financing & Sustainability of School-Based Wellness Centers</h3> This workshop will provide a model for integrated behavioral health services operated through middle or high school Wellness Centers.  Participants will walk away with a Wellness Center guide providing a clear system for accessing services which are reimbursable and integrated within the school.  Services include Coordination of Services Team Meetings, peer services, mentoring, outreach, case management, behavioral health direct services, group services, and other means of correction. Presenter: Jose Campos , MEd, MEd Admin, Director, Jurupa Unified School District <h3>IEHP Healthy School Program</h3> In collaboration with Local Education Agencies (LEAs), aligning with the statewide initiative – the Student Behavioral Health Incentive Program (SBHIP) and IEHP’s Health Navigator (HN) Program – we seek to provide targeted services and supports to identified students and their families. The Program empowers IEHP Members to easily access preventive services and receive care for their chronic conditions (i.e., Asthma, etc.). The Program promotes appropriate utilization of health care services such as: the afterhours Nurse Advice Line Urgent Care Clinics, and Primary Care Providers to ensure Members receive the care they need when they need it and at the right place and at the right time. This promotion of appropriate health care utilization will ensure students are in school ready to learn! The HN will also make sure to connect students and their families to community and Health Plan resources based on need. As a program, we intend to form strong partnerships with school staff (counselors, health aides, Principals, teachers, office personnel, etc.) to help support the students/families in need in areas of physical, mental, and social wellbeing. Presenter: Sonia Rivas , Health Navigator Program Manager, Inland Empire Health Plan <h3>Transforming Our Partnerships for Student Success: Addressing Behavioral Health and Non-Academic Needs in an Upstream and Universal Manner</h3> This workshop will share the successes and learnings from a 4-year partnership between Riverside University Health System and Hemet Unified School District. Through a system of tiered behavioral health services, universal holistic health screening, and onsite and community-based support, students and families have behavioral health and non-academic needs met. 7,000+ unique students across 7 schools have been screened through the program, and over 4,500 behavioral health services and 93,000 units of social services have been delivered. Of note, the percentage of students with concerning behavioral health needs has decreased from a baseline of 15% in 2020 to 7% in 2023.

Screen in the Classroom</h3> Screening in the classroom is the least time and resource intensive. The SBHC can give a class presentation about the clinic, services available, and purpose of screening. They can also provide some health education (i.e., meaning of minor consent, confidentiality, psychoeducation/mindfulness). Then students can complete the confidential screen as a large group or in small groups of 5-8 (hard copy or electronic). <h4>Pros</h4> <h4>Cons</h4> <h3>2. Screen During Clinic Tour</h3> Students can visit the SBHC in small groups or as a whole class. Hands-on/participatory stations can be set up for students to get familiar with the health center. One station should be dedicated to helping the youth complete the screen. SBHCs could make this a ‘career exploration’ – an opportunity to/talk to career professionals at each station. <h4>Pros</h4> <h4>Cons</h4> <h3>3. Screen During Clinic Visit & Registration</h3> Students complete the paperwork to enroll as a clinic patient (can happen prior to visit). Students can visit the SBHC in small groups or as a whole class. Stations can be set up for students to get familiar with the health center. Students receive a brief one-on-one provider visit. This visit is billable (MediCal or Family PACT). <h4>Pros</h4> <h4>Cons</h4> <h2>Location of Screening SBHC Space</h2> If you need private areas for confidential discussions or exams, consider how other space in your clinic might be re-purposed in addition to the exam rooms (such as offices, conference rooms, or lab areas) in order to increase your capacity for seeing multiple patients at once. Don’t forget to consider spatial logistics and potentials for bottlenecks in your flow, such as only having one bathroom in your clinic if your goal is to collect urine samples for STI screening on multiple students in a short period of time. If other clinic services will be suspended during the event, develop a secondary plan for how urgent or acute drop-in visits will be handled. If you anticipate generating a large number of follow-up visits from your program, consider how you might adjust future clinic schedules and/or recruit additional staff or providers to accommodate. Be creative in maximizing space for your screening needs. If your program includes interventions that are non-invasive and/or can be conducted in semi-private areas, consider talking to the school about using large areas such as the gym, cafeteria, or auditorium and developing temporary privacy screens or partitions to divide up the space. If you use a venue outside the clinic for screening, but patient recruitment and/or exposure to your clinic is one of your goals, see if there is a way to incorporate a visit to the clinic as part of the screening program. <h2>Timing of Screening Program Duration</h2> Once you have determined the group and approximate numbers of students you intend to screen, create a detailed and realistic schedule for your screening event, including checking in students, onsite health education, measurements, surveys, additional testing you will include, and any face-to-face time with a provider. This should result in an estimate of the staffing you will need and the number of students you can feasibly screen in one class period. Then estimate the number of class periods it will take to complete screening for your population of choice. As soon as possible, contact the school administration to review the overall school calendar and identify a time that will avoid major schedule conflicts, such as school vacations, standardized testing weeks, and/or other school-wide celebrations (graduation, etc.) and allow adequate time for follow-up. If the school desires the screening program to coincide with a particular course (i.e., science, health, etc.), be sure to consult with teachers as to when it might fit best in the curricular plan. If you are planning to incorporate the use of health profession trainees to expand your personnel capabilities, consult with program faculty to determine if trainee availability will coincide with your timeline. The above information will help you narrow down the days and times when your screening program can take place. Even if overall coordination is done with the school administration, it is wise to connect with individual teachers directly to ensure that you are not conflicting with any scheduled classroom initiatives, tests, or field trips.

{"page_id": 3188, "title": "Telehealth", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/telehealth/", "content": "<h2>Telehealth Guide for Schools</h2> <h2>A Sound Investment in Student Health</h2> Schools play a critical role in the social, intellectual, physical, and psychological development of children and adolescents. Providing health services in school settings is a sound investment to ensure that students are prepared to learn, develop, and thrive. However, in a 2018 RAND survey, only 11% of school principals in California reported that primary health care services were provided at their schools. Well beyond their legal obligations, schools and their partners are increasingly making strategic investments in providing resources to students to enhance their health and well-being and promote their social and emotional development so they can succeed in the classroom. For more than 50 years, school-based health centers and wellness centers (SBHC/WC) have been one such strategic investment—a model based on placing comprehensive health care services on school campuses, making care accessible and convenient to students where they spend a significant portion of their day. With the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools and SBHC/WCs transitioned to telehealth services as a strategy for meeting student health needs when school campuses were closed. With improved technology, internet access, and a recognition of the importance of school-based health, telehealth has emerged as an opportunity to serve students more widely and equitably. Telehealth options for schools come in varying forms, with some key models described below. Each option presents unique opportunities depending on the school’s population, health care needs, capacity, and financial resources. School telehealth can also be of great value in providing youth-friendly services for children and adolescents who have interacted with technology their entire lives. According to the national School-Based Health Alliance, only 20% of SBHC/WCs used telehealth in 2016- 2017; that figure rose to 89% during the 2020-2021 school year. It is expected that more SBHC/WCs will use telehealth going forward, even post-pandemic, as the integration of technology in health care continues to improve and become ubiquitous. <h2>What Is Telehealth?</h2> Telehealth is the use of telecommunication technologies to provide patient care by delivering clinical services remotely and from a separate location than the patient. Telehealth can provide timelier and improved access to care by allowing patients to receive care from remote providers. It is a logical way to increase the capacity to address the unmet health care needs of many people, and was an especially critical lifeline for many during the COVID pandemic. Although telehealth has historically been primarily used to increase access to specialty care in underserved regions, it can also be used to provide a range of primary and behavioral health services, including care for minor illnesses (e.g., pink eye, rash), primary preventive care (e.g., well child visits), chronic disease management (e.g., asthma), and mental health counseling/support. It is considered a cost-effective alternative to health care that is provided in person, especially for rural and underserved areas. The term telehealth encompasses the following modalities: This page is focused on synchronous telehealth through audio only and audio-video interactions. <h2>Telehealth in Schools</h2> In order to provide telehealth services to students at school, a few basic ingredients are needed: Equipment Personnel Systems *As needed. Some services, such as mental health, may not require some of these components if audio-only telehealth is utilized. <h2>Benefits for Students</h2> Young people are open to—and already using—telehealth to meet their health needs. Schools can meet teens where they are at with the provision of telehealth services. Telehealth has the potential to increase access to primary, specialty, and mental health care for students, particularly marginalized youth that might otherwise go without access to care due to various socioeconomic factors. Transportation barriers are reduced for youth, parents, and guardians. Older adolescents can use telehealth to access sensitive and confidential care independently. Students and families whose primary language is not English may also be able to access more culturally and linguistically appropriate care through telehealth options. Telehealth can also provide access to types of providers and specialists that may not be available in the immediate community. <h3>Studies & Provider Organizations Support Telehealth in Schools</h3> A recent study analyzing one of the largest school-based telehealth programs in the nation, based in Texas, found that such programs have the potential to reach a large pediatric population that need health care due to lapses in services because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Asthma and other respiratory disease was the primary diagnosis, demonstrating that telehealth is a good option for management of chronic conditions. The American Academy of Pediatrics has endorsed the use of school-based telemedicine for chronic childhood disease and for those that live in rural and underserved areas. The National Association of School Nurses also supports the use of telehealth technology to augment school health services, but not replace in-person health provided by the school nurse.  Other studies have demonstrated that students with access to care through telehealth at school show improved health and education outcomes. A 2021 report commissioned by Common Sense, Hopelab and the California Health Care Foundation on how young people use digital media to manage their mental health found that social media and online tools were a lifeline that many young people needed to get through the pandemic.  Nearly half (47%) of those surveyed reported that they had connected with healthcare providers online using digital tools, including more than one in four (27%) engaging in a video appointment with a provider.  The report also revealed that 65% of adolescents ages 14-17 used health-related mobile apps and 85% searched for health information online. <h2>Telehealth Options for Schools</h2> <h3>Hub and Spoke Model</h3> In this model, a school site, SBHC/WC, or community-based site serves as a central location, or “hub,” where clinical providers are located. Patients and presenting staff or providers, or “spokes,” are located at other locations within the collaborating system or district to support students at those sites as they are connected, via telehealth, to the providers in the “hub.” SBHC/WCs can function as both “hubs” and “spokes” as described in the examples below. Example 1: In Hawaii, one pediatrician located at an SBHC/WC serves students at three other schools by having a well-trained medical assistant at the outlying school present student patients to her so that she can conduct a thorough physical exam by telehealth. This allows the physician to order vaccines and lab tests at that visit and the medical assistant to complete them. In this case, telehealth increases access for those schools and also increases the physician’s efficiency by widening the number of students she can reach and generating additional reimbursement for her SBHC/WC, which operates as the hub. Example 2: In West Virginia, a telemental health program was able to increase access to psychiatric services for SBHC/WC patients who did not have access, reducing the wait time for their initial appointments. In this scenario, they set up a receiving station and equip it with appropriate technology such as a camera, computer, and monitor. Another agency then provides mental health care remotely to students who are in the SBHC/WC location and in partnership with the staff and providers there. This example illustrates an SBHC/WC acting as a telehealth spoke to provide specialty care beyond the scope of the SBHC/WC services. Example 3: Denver Public Schools is piloting a full spoke model at a high school campus that includes well-child visits and some reproductive health. It is exploring whether this model increases student access to quality health care services; early results are promising and the district is also considering a full service SBHC/WC. This example illustrates employing a school nurse or a health technician that supports the spoke end of an enhancement model. SBHC/WCs can also use telehealth to extend their services during breaks or when students are not in school. Many SBHC/WCs provided telehealth services to students who were not in school during the COVID-19 public health emergency. A community health center in Oakland that operates eight SBHC/WCs developed a phone triage line for youth in Oakland during the COVID pandemic when schools and SBHC/WCs were closed and conducted hundreds of video, phone and text-based care for student patients. As SBHC/WCs re-opened in the fall of 2021, many transitioned to a “hybrid” model of care with some visits delivered in person and others provided via the now-established telehealth platform. This broadens options for students and allows them choice in managing their own health. It also allows SBHC/WC providers to work from alternative locations as needed, and to reach students who might not be in school. Some SBHC/WCs use telehealth to extend the traditional boundaries of health care, for example offering yoga classes and helping lead virtual college tours. Local partners can also be leveraged to support telehealth programs. Anthem Blue Cross, a managed care plan serving approximately 1.3 million members across 29 counties in California and framed as a “digital-first” company, is committed to expanding access to care and improving the health status of children and families. Together with other managed care organizations, Anthem formed a multi-payer collaborative approach to offer safety net clinics in the Central Valley no-cost access to e-consults to expand access to specialty care. These plans make e-consults accessible to federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), rural health centers, and Indian Health Centers at no cost. This includes the UCSF Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Portal through which SBHC/WC and other providers can request psychiatry consultations and which includes free one-time virtual visits for SBHC/WCs operated by FQHCs. To expand the use and availability of telehealth with SBHC/WCs, Anthem is also offering to safety net clinics and SBHC/WCs a no-cost Virtual Case Kiosk Program, which includes a digital kiosk that comes on a rolling cart or stand with multiple video conference applications pre-configured on the iPad. The digital kiosk can be ideal for SBHC/WCs without a telehealth solution or can be used to expand telehealth services to other local schools. The Virtual Care Kiosk program works with multiple video conference apps and includes on-demand interpreter services with over 200 languages, very minimal lag time, no cost for Anthem patients, and discounted costs for others. <h3>Schools without SBHC/WCs</h3> Schools and school districts that do not have the benefit of SBHC/WCs and want to offer telehealth services to students can select among established telehealth providers, partner with community-based health care providers, or create their own program. There are a number of existing agencies that provide telehealth primary care services or other telehealth services. Hazel Health specifically focuses on providing this care in school settings. One school district in Southern California contracts with Hazel Health to deliver physical health services via telehealth for students as part of its solution to address student health and wellness. Hazel Health provided the district with equipment such as a locked medication cart and iPad rolling cart and a series of trainings for health aides and school nurses to establish a protocol and workflow. They targeted students who experienced chronic absenteeism and students who needed additional care or coverage. The cost to the district is based on the total number of enrolled students and the district used its Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) and Learning Communities for Student Success (LCSSP) grant funding to support its subscription. Utilization of this program has been lower than anticipated underscoring the importance/challenge of establishing trust and confidence with a purely telehealth provider. These arrangements are relatively simple for school districts because of their “plug-and-play” nature but may require the school district to cover the full costs of the program, as opposed to generating reimbursement through Medi-Cal or other sources. Schools can work with local providers and partners to create their own telehealth programs. Because of the COVID pandemic, many more community-based health providers (i.e. community health centers, mental health agencies) have new capacity and expertise in delivering telehealth services. Partnering with these organizations to create telehealth arrangements can be a fruitful strategy for school districts without SBHC/WCs. These arrangements are relatively simple for school districts because of their “plug-and-play” nature but can cost districts significantly more than a similar community-based service because they are unable to recoup many costs through Medi-Cal, CHIP, or other insurance reimbursement. They also lack natural connections to the local health care safety net and do not typically provide well care or sexual and reproductive health services. This is a good option for school districts with a low concentration of students who are eligible for free or reduced price meals and for primary school grades. The dedicated help for start-up is positive but may leave school districts with a large price tag. Schools can work with local providers and partners to create their own telehealth program but this can be complicated and time-consuming. It is best achieved through close partnerships with local health care providers that know the requirements, limitations, legal, and financial terrain. If a school does not have an SBHC/WC and is interested in starting a telehealth program, we recommend they reach out to their local community health center. CSHA is available to help schools identify and connect them to potential community-based partners. CSHA encourages all schools – especially schools with more than 500 students and a high concentration of those eligible for free and reduced price meals to consider starting an SBHC/WC on their campus. SBHC/WCs take advantage of in-person relationships to establish trust in a way that not only addresses the health care needs but helps connect students more firmly to school. SBHC/WCs can also help schools create a positive caring school climate. The schools most likely to find value and have the capacity to house brick-and-mortar SBHC/WCs are large schools with a high proportion of students who are eligible for free and reduced price meals (i.e., Title I schools), since SBHC/WCs are able to generate reimbursement from services delivered to students enrolled in the Medi-Cal program.

Much of this rise can be attributed to the deceptive marketing tactics employed by the tobacco industry, leading many youths to perceive vaping as a means of stress relief. According to data from the Truth Initiative, a majority of youth who have used e-cigarettes started vaping to decrease their feelings of stress, anxiety or depression, and 50% of youth report they continue to vape to deal with stress or anxiety. While youth may turn to vaping to deal with their increasing stress, the evidence shows that vaping can have the opposite effect, actually worsening mental health symptoms, and creating a cycle of addiction that has negative consequences on the physical and mental health of youth. Many young people are unaware that vaping as a coping strategy may actually make them feel worse.  School health staff have a critical role in increasing awareness of the connections between youth vaping and mental well-being. <h2>The Nicotine Addiction Cycle</h2> An understanding of the nicotine addiction cycle can help to contextualize how vaping and other uses of nicotine intersects with mental health. The cycle starts once a young person uses a vape. This initial experience often includes moments of euphoria and improved mood, which can be intensely pleasurable. However, this pleasure is short-lived. As it dissipates, youth may repeatedly vape to try and recreate that pleasurable sensation. This repeated usage can quickly lead to the development of a high tolerance, ultimately resulting in nicotine dependence. This dependence manifests through withdrawal symptoms, which may trigger feelings of anxiety, irritability, and a focus on when they can vape next to recapture that sense of well-being. This cycle of craving perpetuates itself, creating a continuous loop. <h2>Nicotine Impact on the Brain</h2> Nicotine constricts blood vessels and increases heart rate. Research suggests that nicotine may trigger cortisol production which causes us to falsely believe that nicotine helps us manage stress more effectively. However, by regularly consuming a substance that replicates a stress response in our bodies when performing everyday tasks, we risk overexposing our bodies to cortisol and other stress hormones that disrupt the body’s processes and put us at risk for poor mental health. Nicotine also increases nicotinic receptors over time , which provides that stressful feeling every time those receptors aren’t getting nicotine. <h2>How School-Based Health Centers & Wellness Centers Can Support Youth with Addiction</h2> It’s important to remember that supporting youth with addiction is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a collaborative approach involving schools, school health partners, parents/guardians, and community resources. <h2>Therapeutic Interventions</h2>", "modified": "2025-09-10T23:07:57", "slug": "vaping", "status": "publish", "excerpt": "The Detrimental Intersection of Vaping & Youth Mental Health Over the past decade, there has been a notable surge in the number of young people turning to vaping products that contain nicotine, a trend exacerbated by the ongoing youth mental health crisis.

Kerman Unified opened a school-based health center (SBHC) in 2013 to serve all students at the eight schools in the district. It is operated by Valley Health Team, a local Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). Robert Frausto, the Superintendent of Kerman Unified, said he chose the site for the SBHC strategically because the school campus is located within walking distance for all students in the district. The SBHC is staffed by a full-time physician, behavioral health clinicians, and two medical assistants. It has three exam rooms for primary care services. Providers see students and community members for well-child visits, sports physicals, hearing and vision screenings, sick visits, and behavioral health, among many other services. Students have a separate entrance to the clinic and the SBHC partners with the school nurse to care for students injured while at school. Watch a video tour of the SBHC. The behavioral health clinic provides mental health care for students – ranging from serious concerns about trauma to just needing someone to talk to. Primary care and behavioral health are integrated and the team collaborates daily to provide optimal care to patients. In 2020, the clinic began offering drive-through COVID testing to members of the community. COVID vaccinations are also being offered at the site. “A few weeks back my daughter who attends Kerman Middle had a rapid heart rate. I brought her to a Valley Health Team clinic. The school site now has all the information so if anything should arise in the future, she can get care right away.” – parent of a Kerman Unified student Superintendent Frausto credits the SBHC with Kerman Unified’s award-winning attendance record because it cuts down on absences that many times are caused by students missing a full day of school because of a doctor’s appointment. Those visits are now much more efficient because students do not have to leave campus. Superintendent Frausto says his district’s solid partnership with Valley Health Team is key to the success of the SBHC in meeting the needs of the students and the community. He recalls one year when 30 kindergarten students all needed vaccinations or they would not be able to start school. He called up Valley Health Team and the immunizations were handled at the SBHC in short order. Valley Health Team CEO Soyla Griffin says her FQHC’s mission is to do whatever it takes to keep children in the community healthy, and the SBHC is a great way to achieve that goal. Parents also credit the SBHC with providing them with a sense of security. “A few weeks back my daughter who attends Kerman Middle had a rapid heart rate. I brought her to a Valley Health Team clinic. The school site now has all the information so if anything should arise in the future, she can get care right away,” said a parent of a Kerman Unified student. <h2>Stay Up-to-Date on School-Based Health</h2> Sign up to receive our free newsletter and advocate for kids’ health.

Provide each group with a poster paper and assortment of markers. Explain that the group brainstorming process will consist of a process called Mind Mapping. During the process, participants will freely brainstorm ideas for how to improve the current response system. Give the following instructions to the group:1. Start with a blank page. Make sure the sheet is in ‘landscape’ mode, so the long side is towards 2. you. In the middle of the sheet, write your central topic. Group 1-”High Impact Event,” Group 2-”Crisis,” and Group 3-”Emergency.” This central concept is what the map is all about. 3. Considering the information covered today and in previous workshops, brainstorm policy and practice recommendations. Consider aspects of prevention, preparation, intervention, and recovery. 4. As you brainstorm, add your information by creating a radial map. This means the information starts in the middle and is added towards the outside of the sheet. Create branches around the central topic to include subtopics. For example--a subtopic could be “administration” or a subtopic could be “prevention”Participants are encouraged to brainstorm without limits. Include all ideas throughout the map.

Team includes members of senior leadership team, family engagement team, general education and special education educators & specialists (speech therapists, mental health clinicians).A high-impact event is a traumatic event that affects multiple people in the school community and significantly disrupts our coping and problem-solving abilities. It is typically sudden, unexpected, and threatening to sense of safety. It may create a sense of helplessness, hopelessness and vulnerability.A mental health crisis is a non-life-threatening situation in which an individual is exhibiting extreme emotional disturbance or behavioral distress, considering harm to self or others, disoriented or out of touch with reality, has a compromised ability to function, or is otherwise agitated and unable to be calmed. (example: threatening harm to self or others with no immediate access to means and not actively attempting to do so)A mental health emergency is a life-threatening situation in which an individual is imminently threatening harm to self or others, severely disorientated or out of touch with reality, has a severe inability to function, or is otherwise distraught and out of control (actively attempting to harm others or self; if harm to others, is not better understood as a mutual conflict)• Clearly defined mental health crisis team.

Attendees included a wide range of school health professionals (e.g., school nurses, mental health providers, clinicians, administrators) who self-selected into the conference session. Most of these participants were not currently implementing ACE screening in a clinical setting. The listening sessions gathered insights from school health staff on their awareness of the ACEs Aware Initiative; current practices, barriers and facilitators around trauma-informed care, ACE and trauma screening, and care coordination; the impact of COVID-19 on schools and SBHCs; and questions and technical assistance needs related to the implementation of ACE screening and trauma-informed care. Listening sessions notes were coded by key themes. Virtual Professional Learning Collaborative: Through our Provider Engagement Peer-to-Peer grant, we hosted a virtual professional learning collaborative with nine school-based health providers (including two physicians, four nurse practitioners, one school counselor, one lead school nurse, one clinical therapist) and two public health researchers from our team. Participants were eligible to participate in the collaborative if they were currently implementing or planning to implement ACE screening in a SBHC setting and could commit to attending all six virtual sessions. Selected applicants represented a diversity of providers based on location (California region, urbanicity, school size), youth demographics (grade level, race/ethnicity, socio-economic status), and provider experience. Participants represented six counties across California serving rural and urban middle and high schools. Two participants represented SBHCs that had a sustained clinical practice of ACE screening; one participant recently started ACE screening in their SBHC, and the remaining participants were planning to implement ACE screening. The collaborative met monthly from November 2020 through April 2021. Sessions included a 50-minute presentation and discussion on a focal topic facilitated by our project team followed by a 30-minute case study presented by a learning collaborative participant. Recordings were transcribed and coded for key themes. In-Depth Interviews: Through our Provider Engagement Network of Care Grant, we identified and invited four SBHCs currently implementing ACE screening to participate in network of care interviews to learn more about the coordination of care at their site. We interviewed ten stakeholders across these four sites, including five SBHC medical providers, two SBHC-affiliated mental health providers, one SBHC medical assistant, one county mental health provider, and one wellness navigator. We were unable to contact school representatives at each site. Three interviewees also participated in the Professional Learning Collaborative. Two participating SBHCs were located at urban high schools, one was located at an urban middle school, and one was located at a rural high school. Recordings were transcribed and coded for key themes. Literature Review and Environmental Scan: We conducted a literature review and environmental scan to understand the landscape of trauma-informed approaches used in a school or pediatric clinical setting, as well as implementation of ACE screenings in these settings. We hoped to learn from the literature how trauma-informed care is implemented in SBHCs and among adolescent populations; barriers and facilitators to implementing trauma-informed care, ACE screening, or mental health services and interventions in a pediatric clinical setting or SBHC; and specific considerations for special populations (e.g., immigrant youth, youth in foster care, justice-involved youth, pregnant and parenting teens, etc.). Search Strategy: We conducted a keyword search on three databases: PubMed, PsycInfo and Web of Science. We conducted searches under the four categories of: broad trauma-informed approaches, buy-in or support to implementing ACE screening or sensitive practices in clinical settings, ACEs in school-based health centers, and screenings in school-based health centers (e.g., SBIRT - Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment, or RAAPS - Rapid Assessment for Adolescent Preventive Services). Some keywords included: pediatrics, clinical care, school-based health centers, school wellness centers, trauma-informed, stakeholder, community, leadership, champions, readiness, engagement, support, ACEs, adverse childhood experiences, trauma-informed care, toxic stress, screening, assessment, SBIRT, RAAPS). Google Scholar and school mental health web resources were also scanned for relevant papers. After duplicates were removed, a total of 215 papers were identified. Inclusion Criteria: Studies were included if they described trauma-informed care or mental health screening in school-based or pediatric clinical settings. All studies were published in English. Included studies were published between 1997-2021. Coding and synthesis: Once studies were identified, titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion and categorized by topic of interest (e.g., trauma-informed care, ACE screening). Within each category, included studies were analyzed to understand barriers, facilitators and recommendations for screening implementation.", "chunks": ["Listening Sessions: Through our Provider Engagement Peer-to-Peer grant, we hosted four virtual listening sessions with a total of 110 attendees of the California School-Based Health Alliance State Conference in October 2020.

Two participants represented SBHCs that had a sustained clinical practice of ACE screening; one participant recently started ACE screening in their SBHC, and the remaining participants were planning to implement ACE screening. The collaborative met monthly from November 2020 through April 2021. Sessions included a 50-minute presentation and discussion on a focal topic facilitated by our project team followed by a 30-minute case study presented by a learning collaborative participant. Recordings were transcribed and coded for key themes. In-Depth Interviews: Through our Provider Engagement Network of Care Grant, we identified and invited four SBHCs currently implementing ACE screening to participate in network of care interviews to learn more about the coordination of care at their site. We interviewed ten stakeholders across these four sites, including five SBHC medical providers, two SBHC-affiliated mental health providers, one SBHC medical assistant, one county mental health provider, and one wellness navigator. We were unable to", "medical assistant, one county mental health provider, and one wellness navigator. We were unable to contact school representatives at each site. Three interviewees also participated in the Professional Learning Collaborative. Two participating SBHCs were located at urban high schools, one was located at an urban middle school, and one was located at a rural high school. Recordings were transcribed and coded for key themes. Literature Review and Environmental Scan: We conducted a literature review and environmental scan to understand the landscape of trauma-informed approaches used in a school or pediatric clinical setting, as well as implementation of ACE screenings in these settings. We hoped to learn from the literature how trauma-informed care is implemented in SBHCs and among adolescent populations; barriers and facilitators to implementing trauma-informed care, ACE screening, or mental health services and interventions in a pediatric clinical setting or SBHC; and specific considerations for special populations (e.g., immigrant youth, youth in foster care, justice-involved youth, pregnant and parenting teens, etc.). Search Strategy: We conducted a keyword search on three databases: PubMed, PsycInfo and Web of Science. We conducted searches under the four categories of: broad trauma-informed approaches, buy-in or support to implementing ACE screening or sensitive practices in clinical settings, ACEs in school-based health centers, and screenings in school-based health centers (e.g., SBIRT - Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment, or RAAPS - Rapid Assessment for Adolescent Preventive Services). Some keywords included: pediatrics, clinical care, school-based health centers, school wellness centers, trauma-informed, stakeholder, community, leadership, champions, readiness, engagement, support, ACEs, adverse childhood experiences, trauma-informed care, toxic stress, screening, assessment, SBIRT, RAAPS). Google Scholar and school mental health web resources were also scanned for relevant papers. After duplicates were removed, a total of 215 papers were identified. Inclusion Criteria: Studies were included if they described trauma-informed care or mental health screening in school-based or pediatric clinical settings. All studies were published in English. Included studies were published between 1997-2021. Coding and synthesis: Once studies were identified, titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion and categorized by topic of interest (e.g., trauma-informed care, ACE screening). Within each category, included studies were analyzed to understand barriers, facilitators and recommendations for screening implementation."]}, "heading_number": 9, "subheading_number": null, "heading_page_number": 27, "excerpt": "<p>The project conducted virtual listening sessions, a professional learning collaborative, and in-depth interviews with school-based health providers to explore the implementation of ACE screening and trauma-informed care in California schools.

By encouraging staff wellness, sick days can be decreased, insurance costs can be lowered, and employee retention can be increased. Additionally, a healthy school staff can act as role models for the health of their students. Attending to the health of teachers and school staff not only supports these valuable and hard-working professionals, it can improve student health. School staff act as role models for healthy behavior and create better learning environments when they are healthier and less stressed. School-based health centers (SBHCs) have an opportunity to lead staff wellness initiatives that create a culture of health and wellness, build strong partnerships with school sites, and increase clinic utilization. By providing staff wellness services to your school campus, your SBHC will become more integrated into the school you serve, in turn adding value and sustainability to your SBHC. Staff Wellness: Examples & Recommendations Many options exist for SBHCs to implement staff wellness initiatives. The following examples are organized from low cost, easy to implement to examples that require dedicated staff time. Case Study: Check Your Heart Day Preparation: The Logan Health Center (LHC) in Union City wanted to better engage teachers with their SBHC. They surveyed teachers and discovered that many of them wanted to use health services at LHC. One of the health needs identified in the survey was preventive services, such as immunizations and blood pressure checks. With the help of school partners, LHC staff implemented a “Check Your Heart Day” to coincide with Valentine’s Day. Implementation: The LHC promoted the day through putting flyers in teachers’ mailboxes, sending them email reminders, and presenting during a monthly staff meeting. On “Check Your Heart Day,” the LHC Medical Assistant set up a table in the staff lounge, a convenient and comfortable place for staff to access this resource. The LHC did not host this event in their SBHC, making sure that the students’ space and confidentiality was maintained. Next Steps: “Check Your Heart Day” was so popular amongst school staff, the staff at the LHC decided to make it an annual occurrence. Simple, Low-Cost Ideas The following examples can be easily incorporated into the responsibilities of an SBHC health educator or site director with little or no cost to your SBHC. • Create a monthly or quarterly staff wellness newsletter to be sent out via email or staff mailboxes. The newsletters can include staff wellness tips such as healthy recipes or relaxation techniques. Consider including a profile of a teacher who champions health or supports your SBHC. • Stuff staff mailboxes during the winter with “Staff Wellness Packs” that include tea, tissues, cough drops, and other wellness promoting items. • Ask to have a dedicated health space in the teachers’ lounge sponsored by your SBHC. Fill the space with health brochures, posters, and a place to relax. • Host a staff appreciation day. Provide healthy snacks in the teacher’s lounge or during a staff meeting. • Distribute a list of local organizations and health services that staff can access for free or low cost. This can include mental health services, yoga classes, or locations to get flu shots. • Provide trainings on preventing burnout, vicarious trauma, healthy eating, or stress reduction. Case Study: Weight Loss Challenge Preparation: The San Fernando High School Teen Health Center in San Fernando surveyed school staff on wellness activities at their school as part of their work as a Kaiser Hallways to Health site. They administered this survey electronically over the course of two months at the beginning of the year. With over 70 respondents, the San Fernando High School Teen Health Center staff discovered that many teachers wanted more opportunities for physical activity and healthy snack options at school-sponsored meetings. The health center staff shared their results with their administrative ally, the Vice Principal, who asked the health center staff to host a weight loss challenge at the beginning of January, to coincide with New Year’s resolutions. Implementation: The health center staff began promoting the weight loss challenge through their weekly “Wellness Wednesday” newsletter and recruited 20 teachers to participate. The health center provided a space for teachers to weigh themselves on SBHC scales and provided resources on alternative healthy snacks as well as low cost physical activity opportunities. Next Steps: The San Fernando High School Teen Health Center staff will continue to implement the weight loss challenge on an annual basis for school staff. Increase Your Impact • Host an annual or per semester medical clinic day for staff. Services can include TB Tests, blood pressure checks, and flu shots. • Create a monthly healthy food potluck club for staff. • Start a fitness club with staff. A fitness club can be anything from a lunchtime walking club to regular Zumba classes. • Partner or contract with a local studio or school to provide free meditation, yoga classes, massages, or spa services for staff. • Create water stations for staff and distribute SBHC branded water bottles. • Explicitly include staff wellness in the school and district wellness policies. • Advocate for a policy that healthy foods will be provided at all district related gatherings, including staff meetings and teacher work days. • Support a policy through nutrition/food services to provide lunch to staff for free or at a discounted rate. • Lead wellness activities at school staff meetings (e.g., mindfulness, meditation, or stretch breaks) and advocate for these activities to be a incorporated into meeting agendas. Case Study: Healthy Drinking Water Station Preparation: The JFK Student Health & Enrichment Center in Richmond wanted to promote alternatives to sweetened beverages on their school campus. Although vending machines had been removed from campus many years prior, they noticed that many students and staff were not drinking water because the water fountains were in disrepair or thought to be “dirty.” The health center staff worked with their youth advisory board to survey school staff on whether or not teachers and administrators would drink water from an alternative source, such as a water station. After reviewing the survey results and getting support from their principal, they decided to write a grant to Jamba Juice, to have two water stations created on campus, one for students near the SBHC and one for teachers in their lounge. Implementation: The JFK Student Wellness & Enrichment Center staff received the grant from Jamba Juice and bought two water stations. They are currently working with the school district to install the water stations. Next Steps: Once installed, the SBHC staff will post a sign stating: “Fresh water, provided to you by the JFK Student Wellness & Enrichment Center.” Additionally the health center staff are hoping to order SBHC branded water bottles to distribute to staff. Key Steps for SBHCs 1. Get buy-in from administrators and key staff who will support your efforts. 2. Assess staff needs through a survey or key informant interviews. 3. Review the results and create an action plan with your school partner. 4. Do something and start small! Create your first health newsletter, provide a healthy snack in the teacher’s lounge, or host a fitness class. 5. Obtain feedback, adjust your approach, and keep trying. 6. Make it a regular practice and choose projects or activities that can happen again. Although it is wonderful to have a massage day for teachers, you and your staff should examine budgets to see if this can be an annual occurrence.

Centering the concept of community care in the workplace requires both individual and structural work. A concept called Low Impact debriefing is one tool that can be used to avoid Retraumatization and promote community care in relationships between colleagues (and can be useful to use when debriefing your work with others as well). When educators are exposed to stressful things in the course of their work, it is a normal reaction to want to debrief with someone. Low impact debriefing allows us to access support and validation while simultaneously caring for the person offering it to us. Low Impact Debriefing includes the following four principles: 1. Self-Awareness: Understanding why I am sharing and what I hope to get from the interaction. Naming this can improve the efficacy of the debrief. For example:1. “I am not ready to problem solve, I just want someone to validate how upsetting this situation was,” 2. “I need help transitioning out of work so that I can be present with my child this afternoon.”2. Content Warning: It is common in daily life to preface sharing bad news with a pause such as “I need you to sit down, I have something I need to tell you.” The same need exists in debriefs. Let’s imagine your colleague asks “how was your day?” and you’ve just had a day where you had to file a CPS report after a student wrote about being abused in their writing assignment. In order to provide a content warning, you might first give a simple answer such as “it was really hard,” or “I’m so upset about something that happened.” However, before you give details, you might say “I’d like to share something that is pretty upsetting,” or “I had to make a CPS report and it’s hard to get the details out of my mind.” This gives the person a moment to ready themselves for the information if they are able to hear it. 3. Consent: After providing a content warning, you will need to obtain consent. This means asking if someone is available to hear the content and to provide emotional support. It is important when asking for consent that we give space and permission for the person to answer. Only after we have obtained consent should we continue to the next step. If the person does not consent, it is important to acknowledge this and to respect the boundary. Asking for consent might sound like: 1. “Do you have capacity for me to share about what happened today?”2. “I’d like to debrief something with you, are you available for that?” 4. Limited disclosure: When you share, begin with the least traumatic content and gradually get nearer to the more intense content. Consider what details are necessary to share. In the end, you may not need to tell the graphic details. In times when you need to share details ensure that you are maintaining confidentiality and the person who you are debriefing with is appropriate. Especially consider focusing on the impact the event had on you, rather than on giving the other person all of the specific details. BACKGROUNDSaakvitne, K. and Pearlman, L. (2016).

INSTRUCTIONSAsk participants to pause here to join you in a short mindfulness practice before leaving today’s session.Explain that mindfulness is simply the act of noticing or paying attention. Practicing mindfulness routinely can prepare you to use it more effectively in moments of intensity or emotion dysregulation. Mindfulness is something that can be utilized in brief moments during your day. Body ScanFacilitators will lead lead the group through a body scan, taking time to pause between each instruction:Begin by placing both feet on the floor in front of you, hands relaxing on your legs. As we go through this exercise, if you notice your mind wandering that’s ok. Don’t try to change the thoughts, just redirect your attention back to your breath. Now bring your attention into your body.You can close your eyes if that’s comfortable for you, or leave them open with a soft gaze.Notice your body seated wherever you’re seated, feeling the", "leave them open with a soft gaze.Notice your body seated wherever you’re seated, feeling the weight of your body on the chair.Take a few slow, deep breaths.Notice your feet on the floor, notice the sensations of your feet touching the floor. Notice your legs against the chair, pressure, heaviness, lightness.Bring your attention up to your back against the chair. Bring your attention into your stomach area.

Understand Trauma and Stress “Without understanding trauma, we are more likely to misinterpret trauma-related behaviors as willful, “sick,” or “crazy,” which can lead to ineffective, stigmatizing and/or punitive reactions to trauma-impacted people. This reframing can help us to recognize these effects more accurately, which can then lead to more compassionate and strength-based, effective responses to trauma-impacted people that can promote healing as opposed to reacting in a way that inadvertently re-traumatizes and causes harm.” (SFSU) 2. Cultural Humility and Equity When we understand that trauma is caused by structural oppression & work together to mitigate these harms, including through our own self-reflection and understanding of power imbalances in our schools; we enhance equity.3. Establish Safety and Predictability Trauma results when physical, emotional & relational safety is violated. Establishing physical, relational, and emotional safety, as well as predictability in our schools, can assist us in focusing resources on healing & improve students’ ability to attend to learning. 4. Foster Compassionate and Dependable Relationships Trauma is relational in nature so the healing is equally relational. When we foster relationships with students, families, and each other that are compassionate and attuned as well as predictable and dependable, we develop trusting relationships that increase our capacity for healing and learning together. 5. Promote Resilience and Social Emotional Learning Trauma can negatively impact the development of healthy skills in regulating emotions, cognitions, and behaviors, as well as healthy interpersonal skills, which can then compound trauma’s negative effects in the classroom. Promoting wellness practices and teaching social emotional learning competencies of self-management, self-awareness, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision making (CASEL, 2012) can build resilience and support students ability to attend to the tasks of learning. 6. Empowerment and Collaboration Trauma involves a loss of power and control that can cause a sense of helplessness & hopelessness. When students, families, and staff are given meaningful opportunities to participate in the school community, have their strengths acknowledged & built on, and are given voice & choice in what happens, we can develop a community where everyone feels empowered and connected.

Slide 5: Burnout.Ask participants, “who has heard the term burnout? What causes it? What options are there for addressing it?” Explain “we often hear the term “burnout” being used to describe educators’ experiences. While burnout is very common in education & healthcare fields, there is a tendency to conflate it with vicarious trauma which we will get into in a moment. Burnout can occur in any professional or educational setting and is characterized by a depleted ability to cope with work/life demands.”Slide 6: Compassion Fatigue & Vicarious Trauma.The remainder of this is workshop focused on vicarious trauma. The tendency to conflate this with burnout leaves folks experiencing vicarious trauma feeling isolated, misunderstood, and frustrated--particularly when they have employed all of the typical recommendations for managing burnout “take a break, go outside, run a bath” with little effect. While these may be useful strategies for self care, it is important for people working in trauma-impacted environments are provided information and support in managing vicarious trauma. Vicarious trauma & compassion fatigue are terms often used interchangeably to explain the inner-experience of the helper resulting from empathetic engagement with traumatized clients or communities.” Using the definitions included in the slide, discuss with participants that while related, they both describe slightly different experiences.Slide 7: Vicarious Resilience. Vicarious resilience happens when educators (or other helping professionals) experience personal growth in their own life through witnessing the growth of their students. Witnessing students or their families overcome adversity has a positive effect on the professionals supporting them. An educators’ own beliefs and feelings can change and allow them to reassess their own problems and are better able to cope with their own adversity. (Hernandez, Gangsei & Engstrom, 2007).BACKGROUNDFreudenberger, H. (1974). , Burnout: The high cost of high achievement.Hernández P, Gangsei D, Engstrom D. Vicarious resilience: a new concept in work with those who survive trauma. Fam Process. 2007 Jun;46(2):229-41. doi: 10.1111/j.1545-5300.2007.00206.x. PMID: 17593887.REFLECT & SHARE - 5 MINUTESJournal & Group shareMATERIALS• Paper• Writing Utensil INSTRUCTIONSReflectAsk participants to take a few moments to reflect on their work in a trauma-impacted environment. They may choose to reflect through writing, drawing, or thinking about answers to the following prompts: • How has your work in a trauma-impacted school has had a positive influence on the way you see the world, yourself, or what matters to you (your sense of meaning and purpose, hope and faith)?• How has your work in a trauma-impacted school has had a negative or challenging influence on the way you see the world, yourself, or what matters to you?ShareIn small groups of 3-4, or as a large group; give participants an opportunity to share something that came up for them during the exercise. Participants may choose to share an answer to one of the prompts, or share more broadly about what it was like to reflect in this way. This exercise may be one of the few times participants have explicitly been asked to reflect on the challenges of trauma work. It will be important for you to hold a non-judgmental & empathetic space for sharing. If you choose to have participants share in the large group, acknowledge participants’ willingness to share by validating, normalizing and thanking them for their responses. If participants will share in small groups, you will want to encourage listeners in each group to maintain curiosity & empathy for their colleague as well as avoid using this time for problem-solving/advice-giving, or one-upping (i.e. “if you think that’s bad, you won’t believe what happened to me...”)MY MENTAL HEALTH CONTINUUM - 10 MINUTESIndividual Care PlanMATERIALS• “My Mental Health Continuum” Worksheet• Writing utensilINSTRUCTIONSProvide participants with “My Mental Health Continuum” worksheet. Explain that mental health is something everyone has and that it is not a fixed experience. Mental health changes occur in response to the interdependent workings of our internal experiences, external stressors or pleasures, and the environments we are immersed in. For this exercise, we will be reflecting on the ways our own mental health shifts and create a plan that is responsive to those shifts. Review the three categories “thriving,” “surviving,” and “struggling/in-crisis.” Someone who is thriving is able to experience pleasure, successfully utilize a wide range of strategies to respond to life’s challenges, attend to the present while planning for the future, and meaningfully engage in relationships that are important to them. Someone who is surviving is focused on just making it through the day. They are at the limits of their capacity for self-care. They may often be worrying about the inevitable next crisis rather than remain present in the moment. They may find it challenging to engage in the activities they usually enjoy and begin to feel disconnected from the people around them. Someone who is struggling or in-crisis has gone beyond their capacity for self-care. They may be experiencing emotional distress or emotional numbness. They may withdraw, isolate, or avoid meaningful activities. Someone in crisis may be experiencing distressing mental health symptoms that are impairing their ability to engage in work, home, social life, or spiritual practices. People experiencing this level of vicarious trauma often need community care and/or professional support. Bring participants attention to the second column “personal indicators.” For the next several minutes, prompt participants to reflect on the questions: “What is life like when your mental health is thriving? How do you feel? What activities are you engaged in? What do your relationships look like?” Instruct participants to write a few words that describe this state of “thriving” in the associated box. The remainder of the workshop will be spent focusing on the signs and symptoms of vicarious trauma. Ask participants to identify experiences that resonate for them as you review the signs & symptoms of vicarious trauma in the following slides. Give participants a few moments at the end of each slide to note these in the boxes associated with “surviving,” and “struggling.” Advise participants that if they have never experienced the feeling of being in-crisis, that’s great! Have them consider how they might know if they were in the future. Planning ahead for noticing signs can be a powerful tool in healing and wellness. DEEP DIVE: VICARIOUS TRAUMA - 10 MINUTESUnderstanding Signs & Symptoms of Vicarious TraumaMATERIALS• Facilitator slidesINSTRUCTIONS If you think of trauma as information, vicarious trauma is information overload. There is a limit to what we are able to take in and process. The stories of trauma and suffering start to fill us up and can become part of us. Vicarious trauma is a human response to the experience of coming face-to-face with the reality of trauma and the difficulties of the human experience. It can slowly shift our outlook and deny us the perspective of a world that exists beyond the traumatic experience. Despite your best efforts, VT may still be experienced. This doesn’t mean you’ve done anything wrong or that your self-care isn’t “good enough,” just like trauma, vicarious trauma is a physiological response that we can mitigate, but can not always control. Instead, we can feel empowered to understand warning signs so that we can respond compassionately to ourselves should we experience it.Slide 10 : Changes in Worldview/Belief SystemVicarious trauma is unique from more general workplace stress because of the way it can fundamentally transform the way we view ourselves and the world. People immersed in trauma-adjacent work may begin to shift their belief systems. Some changes in belief may be positive, and a reflection of the vicarious resilience discussed earlier. However, a shift to pervasive cynicism, hopelessness, over-identification with ones’ professional role, or a decreased ability to access a sense of safety either in our environment or in ourselves may indicate the presence of vicarious trauma. Examples: • Upon entering the field, you may have felt optimistic and full of big ideas. Now you feel that nothing can be done to improve the issues negatively impacting your community or to change he negative conditions of the education system. • You used to have a variety of interests and hobbies that were central to how you moved through the world. Perhaps you were a basketball player, a writer, a bird enthusiast, or a painter. Now it is hard to imagine viewing yourself in any role outside of your trauma work. Slide 11: Psychological/Emotional The psychological and emotional toll of trauma work can show up as a heightened sensitivity and emotional intensity or as the other side of the same coin in the form of emotional numbing and minimizing. People experiencing vicarious trauma may notice they have an increasingly difficult time managing distress--this may look like increased tearfulness, anxiety, or an inability to tolerate the intense emotions of others. Some people may experience a disconnection from their emotional experiences. Having chronically been exposed to the effects of trauma, their way of coping is to disconnect from their own internal experiences in order to “push through,” and avoid. This may also lead to symptoms of depression or inability to find pleasure in one’s life. Examples: • You may find yourself constantly on guard or bracing yourself for the next crisis. • You could have a difficult time accessing empathy when a student or colleague shares about a stressful or traumatic event in their life. • You may share common identity or community with the students you teach. Perhaps you grew up in the same neighborhood, share a marginalized identity, or experienced your own childhood trauma and now find yourself feeling guilty for your own survival. Slide12: SomaticThe physiological response to trauma is an intensely somatic experience. When we are threatened we go into fight, flight, or freeze mode, our survival brains take over, and we experience an enormous surge of energy. What is left over of that energy is expressed through physical movements like trembling or crying. When this process is inhibited, it leads to dysregulation of the nervous system. This may result in physical symptoms such as digestive problems and sleep disturbances. Slide 13: BehavioralPeople experiencing vicarious trauma may exhibit certain behaviors in an attempt to cope. Examples of such behaviors are included here. These behaviors can develop as a way to self-soothe or to “check out” from the emotional pain.Examples: • You may find excuses to avoid routine staff meetings that you used to attend with no issue. • You may notice an increase in arguments with your partner or find yourself having big reactions to what would previously have been minor conflicts. • You could find yourself feeling the need to routinely decompress with drugs or alcohol in order to “turn off” your work mind. Slide 14: RelationalYour role as an educator is fundamentally relational in nature. When these relationships are also impacted by the presence of individual and collective trauma, it may affect the way the educator engages with those around them. They may find it difficult to form nourishing relationships, avoid intimacy, feel the need to be self-sufficient, or feel unable to meaningfully connect with people who are not in a similar helping profession. Examples: • You may find that nearly all of your social interactions are with colleagues or others in the helping professions. You may find it difficult to relate or may even find yourself judging people who are not in a similar field.• You may find yourself taking on a large amount of extra tasks “for the sake of the students,” and have a hard time receiving assistance even when it is offered. • You may notice a decrease in pleasure in your partnerships or friendships. Included in the content notes of each slide are examples of ways these signs and symptoms may emerge. You may wish to choose one or two to support participants in making connections between clinical language and personal experiences. BACKGROUNDvan Dernoot Lipsky, Laura. (2009). Trauma Stewardship.

SELF-ASSESSMENT - 10 MINUTESPro-QOLMATERIALS• ProQOL5 Self-Assessment WorksheetsINSTRUCTIONSSelf-AssessmentGive participants brief background on the Pro-QOL. The Professional Quality of Life Measure (Pro-QOL) is a free resource developed by researchers, educators, and clinicians. It is used to take inventory of one’s compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary/vicarious trauma. Distribute a copy of Pro-QOL 5, Self-Score to all participants. Instruct participants to spend the next 7-8 minutes completing the self-assessment to take inventory on the ways exposure to secondary trauma is currently affecting them. Taking inventory in this way can help in creating a plan for healing and care that specifically addresses the impact. If you will be following this session with Vicarious Trauma Part II, request participants bring their ProQOL to the next session. Assure participants that the next session will be entirely focused on responding to †he question of “now what?” and explore a variety of strategies for responding to vicarious trauma both individually and collectively. If you are unable to provide Vicarious Trauma Part II as follow-up to this session, encourage participants to utilize the results from the Pro-QOL to engage in a practice of setting intentional goals for self and community care. A useful tool for guiding this practice is exploring the “Five Directions” found in Laura Van Dernoot Lipsky’s, “Trauma Stewardship.”BACKGROUNDB. Hudnall Stamm (2009).

During set-up, spread the images across the table (s) or center of circleWelcome participants to part II of the Vicarious Trauma workshop. Explain that the session will focus on moving from awareness to response & healing.

(If you are facilitating this session with participants unfamiliar with one another, also include introductions during this activity). OverviewBegin by sharing this quote by Nakita Valerio (award-winning writer, academic, and community organizer based in Edmonton, Canada.): “Shouting ‘self-care’ at people who actually need community care is how we fail people.”Slide 17: How we choose to care for ourselves has an impact on our overall health, which makes self-care practice important. However assuming that people always have the capability, accessibility, or power to care for themselves is flawed. True healing requires an approach that is responsive to this. Today we will discuss strategies for self-care, and we will also go further to identify strategies for community care & systemic change to prevent or alleviate distress related to vicarious trauma.", "chunks": ["WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE? - 8 MINUTESCreating shared language & context for exploring vicarious traumaMATERIALS• Facilitator SlidesINSTRUCTIONSSlide 4: Vicarious trauma and burnout are terms often terms used interchangeably; however there are key distinctions between them. Slide 5: Burnout.Ask participants, “who has heard the term burnout? What causes it? What options are there for addressing it?” Explain “we often hear the term “burnout” being used to describe educators’ experiences. While burnout is very common in education & healthcare fields, there is a tendency to conflate it with vicarious trauma which we will get into in a moment. Burnout can occur in any professional or educational setting and is characterized by a depleted ability to cope with work/life demands.”Slide 6: Compassion Fatigue & Vicarious Trauma.The remainder of this is workshop focused on vicarious trauma. The tendency to conflate this with burnout leaves folks experiencing vicarious trauma feeling isolated, misunderstood, and frustrated--particularly when they have employed all of the typical recommendations for managing burnout “take a break, go outside, run a bath” with little effect. While these may be useful strategies for self care, it is important for people working in trauma-impacted environments are provided information and support in managing vicarious trauma. Vicarious trauma & compassion fatigue are terms often used interchangeably to explain the inner-experience of the helper resulting from empathetic engagement with traumatized clients or communities.” Using the definitions included in the slide, discuss with participants that while related, they both describe slightly different experiences.Slide 7: Vicarious Resilience. Vicarious resilience happens when educators (or other helping professionals) experience personal growth in their own life through witnessing the growth of their students. Witnessing students or their families overcome adversity has a positive effect on the professionals supporting them. An educators’ own beliefs and feelings can change and allow them to reassess their own problems and are better able to cope with their own adversity.

PMID: 17593887.REFLECT & SHARE - 5 MINUTESJournal & Group shareMATERIALS• Paper• Writing Utensil INSTRUCTIONSReflectAsk participants to take a few moments to reflect on their work in a trauma-impacted environment. They may choose to reflect through writing, drawing, or thinking about answers to the following prompts: • How has your work in", "drawing, or thinking about answers to the following prompts: • How has your work in a trauma-impacted school has had a positive influence on the way you see the world, yourself, or what matters to you (your sense of meaning and purpose, hope and faith)?• How has your work in a trauma-impacted school has had a negative or challenging influence on the way you see the world, yourself, or what matters to you?ShareIn small groups of 3-4, or as a large group; give participants an opportunity to share something that came up for them during the exercise. Participants may choose to share an answer to one of the prompts, or share more broadly about what it was like to reflect in this way. This exercise may be one of the few times participants have explicitly been asked to reflect on the challenges of trauma work. It will be important for you to hold a non-judgmental & empathetic space for sharing. If you choose to have participants share in the large group, acknowledge participants’ willingness to share by validating, normalizing and thanking them for their responses. If participants will share in small groups, you will want to encourage listeners in each group to maintain curiosity & empathy for their colleague as well as avoid using this time for problem-solving/advice-giving, or one-upping (i.e. “if you think that’s bad, you won’t believe what happened to me...”)MY MENTAL HEALTH CONTINUUM - 10 MINUTESIndividual Care PlanMATERIALS• “My Mental Health Continuum” Worksheet• Writing utensilINSTRUCTIONSProvide participants with “My Mental Health Continuum” worksheet. Explain that mental health is something everyone has and that it is not a fixed experience. Mental health changes occur in response to the interdependent workings of our internal experiences, external stressors or pleasures, and the environments we are immersed in. For this exercise, we will be reflecting on the ways our own mental health shifts and create a plan that is responsive to those shifts. Review the three categories “thriving,” “surviving,” and “struggling/in-crisis.” Someone who is thriving is able to experience pleasure, successfully utilize a wide range of strategies to respond to life’s challenges, attend to the present while planning for the future, and meaningfully engage in relationships that are important to them. Someone who is surviving is focused on just making it through the day. They are at the limits of their capacity for self-care. They may often be worrying about the inevitable", "the limits of their capacity for self-care. They may often be worrying about the inevitable next crisis rather than remain present in the moment. They may find it challenging to engage in the activities they usually enjoy and begin to feel disconnected from the people around them. Someone who is struggling or in-crisis has gone beyond their capacity for self-care. They may be experiencing emotional distress or emotional numbness. They may withdraw, isolate, or avoid meaningful activities. Someone in crisis may be experiencing distressing mental health symptoms that are impairing their ability to engage in work, home, social life, or spiritual practices. People experiencing this level of vicarious trauma often need community care and/or professional support. Bring participants attention to the second column “personal indicators.” For the next several minutes, prompt participants to reflect on the questions: “What is life like when your mental health is thriving? How do you feel? What activities are you engaged in? What do your relationships look like?” Instruct participants to write a few words that describe this state of “thriving” in the associated box. The remainder of the workshop will be spent focusing on the signs and symptoms of vicarious trauma. Ask participants to identify experiences that resonate for them as you review the signs & symptoms of vicarious trauma in the following slides. Give participants a few moments at the end of each slide to note these in the boxes associated with “surviving,” and “struggling.” Advise participants that if they have never experienced the feeling of being in-crisis, that’s great! Have them consider how they might know if they were in the future. Planning ahead for noticing signs can be a powerful tool in healing and wellness. DEEP DIVE: VICARIOUS TRAUMA - 10 MINUTESUnderstanding Signs & Symptoms of Vicarious TraumaMATERIALS• Facilitator slidesINSTRUCTIONS If you think of trauma as information, vicarious trauma is information overload. There is a limit to what we are able to take in and process. The stories of trauma and suffering start to fill us up and can become part of us. Vicarious trauma is a human response to the experience of coming face-to-face with the reality of trauma and the difficulties of the human experience. It can slowly shift our outlook and deny us the perspective of a world that exists beyond the traumatic experience. Despite your best efforts, VT may still be experienced. This doesn’t mean you’ve done", "experience. Despite your best efforts, VT may still be experienced. This doesn’t mean you’ve done anything wrong or that your self-care isn’t “good enough,” just like trauma, vicarious trauma is a physiological response that we can mitigate, but can not always control. Instead, we can feel empowered to understand warning signs so that we can respond compassionately to ourselves should we experience it.Slide 10 : Changes in Worldview/Belief SystemVicarious trauma is unique from more general workplace stress because of the way it can fundamentally transform the way we view ourselves and the world. People immersed in trauma-adjacent work may begin to shift their belief systems. Some changes in belief may be positive, and a reflection of the vicarious resilience discussed earlier. However, a shift to pervasive cynicism, hopelessness, over-identification with ones’ professional role, or a decreased ability to access a sense of safety either in our environment or in ourselves may indicate the presence of vicarious trauma. Examples: • Upon entering the field, you may have felt optimistic and full of big ideas. Now you feel that nothing can be done to improve the issues negatively impacting your community or to change he negative conditions of the education system. • You used to have a variety of interests and hobbies that were central to how you moved through the world. Perhaps you were a basketball player, a writer, a bird enthusiast, or a painter. Now it is hard to imagine viewing yourself in any role outside of your trauma work. Slide 11: Psychological/Emotional The psychological and emotional toll of trauma work can show up as a heightened sensitivity and emotional intensity or as the other side of the same coin in the form of emotional numbing and minimizing.

This means that we begin first by turning inward, identifying and responding to our own emotions in order to foster a space where others can do the same. Understanding ModelingOne powerful tool in teaching emotion regulation is modeling. Modeling is beneficial because it is relational, interactive, and doesn’t require any special lesson plans or additional class time. As educators, we can practice this regularly as a way to both teach emotion regulation as well as share in ways that allow us to be known by our students. We can do this in the moments we feel happy, frustrated, disappointed and anywhere in between. For example, if we get stuck in traffic on the way to school and arrive without time for our usual prep, we might say “I feel a little anxious because I was caught in traffic and wasn’t able to make the photocopies we were going to use this morning. I’m going to take a few moments to breathe while you all complete the do-now so that the rest of our time together can feel less frazzled.” Name your own feelings and connect them to behaviors regularly.Practice!In a small group, pick one feeling you brought with you to work this week & practice connecting it to a thought and/or behavior.Reframing PraiseIn addition to modeling, educators can also shift their framework. Instead of rewarding behavior i.e. “thank-you for completing your math homework today;” reward students by reflecting back the social-emotional skills they used to get to the behavior. For example “you were really frustrated with the homework yesterday and you found a way to get it turned in today. I’m really proud of you!” Or “great job letting me know when you were feeling bored and finding a way to stay focused by using that fidget during the lesson.” Thank you for noticing that you were upset and taking some space so we could have a calm conversation about it.”RESPOND - 7 MINUTESMATERIALS• Survival Brain-->Learning Brain Cards• Elevator Empathy WorksheetsINSTRUCTIONSBegin first by providing information about the DNA process (Bailey 2001). Once an educator becomes the thermostat, they are more readily available to notice and respond to students experiencing moments of dysregulation. One strategy covered today is known as DNA. DNA stands for “describe, notice & name, and acknowledge.” 1. Describe: This involves describing objective, observable behavior. For example “your head is down on your desk,” or “your face is all scrunched like this [mirror back to them.]” Describe can be both verbal as well as non-verbal. Non-verbal mirroring can be useful when students are dysregulated and having a difficult time hearing what you are saying. We describe in a neutral, calm tone and the same is true in mirroring--we repeat the behavior back to them without any theatrics or exaggeration.2. Pause: After describing, you will often want to take a pause. Here we can engage students through co-regulation. We may take a deep breath, sit calmly next to them, lower our shoulders, etc. in an attempt to support students’ ability to regulate their nervous system. 3. Notice & Name: Notice & name the emotion you are seeing. “You’re disappointed,” or “I can see that you’re frustrated.” 4. Acknowledge: Next, quickly acknowledge what the child wanted or the unmet need. It is important to notice & acknowledge in quick succession of each other in order to support the student in developing the ability to link events with feelings. For example “you’re disappointed, you wanted to keep playing on the swingset,” or “I can see that you’re frustrated, you were unsure about the answer to the math problem”It’s important to note that the antecedent or the feelings attached may be unknown by the educator. However, making a guess and allowing space to be corrected by the student can be just as useful. Just acknowledging that a student is having a challenging feeling can be validating, even when it takes several attempts to identify it. When a student provides a correction, i.e. “I’m angry, not sad;” continue without pause to reflect this back “oh, thanks for letting me know. Mary took the pencil without asking and you’re feeling really angry about it.” PRACTICE! - 8 MINUTESINSTRUCTIONSElevator EmpathyIn pairs, complete the elevator empathy (page 11 in workbook) activity together. Spend several minutes as a full group sharing possible responses to each of the scenarios. LEARNING BRAIN - 20 MINUTESINSTRUCTIONSPutting It All TogetherThe process of DNA supports students to move out of a “survival brain,” into conscious awareness of their emotions. Once the student has shifted out of survival brain and into this awareness, it is time to support them in making a choice about what to do with that emotion. Offering choice and empowering students to have agency is an important piece of trauma-informed care and of teaching effective self management skills. Educators can do this in a number of ways and do not need to remove academic rigor in order to accomplish it. A choice might be “you can skip that question for now and come back to it later or I can help you with it now;” or “would you rather take the assignment to a quiet room to finish or join the rest of the class?” It is important to note that for some students in a highly escalated state, the process to return to equilibrium can be a lengthy one. This is why it will be important to have a school-wide trauma-informed plan in place. An educator may be able to reduce escalation and notice that a student still needs time before they are able to return to academics. If this is the case, they may be offered an in-classroom option “i.e. you can take 10 minutes in the calm corner or at your desk with this mindfulness video” or an out of the classroom option “you can take 10 minutes in the calm room or sitting with Ms. Matias in the main office until you’re ready to return.”Practice!Participants will now practice joining all parts of the de-escalation process together. Divide participants into groups of 4-5. Each group will be given a set of cards--each representing a different part of the de-escalation process, as well as a set of scenarios. 1. Survival Brain: This represents the “D” in DNA. Simply describe the behavior you notice. This can be done verbally & non-verbally. 2. Pause: The process of coregulation. Practice taking a breath or doing other self-regulatory practices in order to be able to move through the next pieces calmly.3. Emotion Brain: This represents the “N” & “A” of DNA. First notice & name the antecedent and then quickly acknowledge the feeling. 4. Learning Brain: The process of shifting back into conscious decision making. Offer a choice here that is aligned with your classroom/school’s values, norms, and expectations.Instruct participants to each take one of the cards and to physically put themselves in order from “Survival Brain” -->”Pause”-->”Emotion Brain” --> “Learning Brain.” Ask for one person to read the scenario aloud to the group. Each person will then give a response from their part of the process. Rotate through roles until each member has been given at least one opportunity to practice in each. Facilitators may wish to ask for four volunteers to demonstrate the activity in front of the full group before breaking off into small groups to practice. Applying DNA to a GroupExpand on the topic of de-escalation by acknowledging that escalation is not reserved for individual students, but can also have a wider community impact. Educators can apply similar principals and strategies when responding to a group. When a group of students is escalated and/or impacted by a classroom disruption, educators can use this as an opportunity for modeling, utilizing DNA, and engaging the full group in a brief emotion regulation activity to return to a state of calm. An example of this might sound like: “Sam was upset so he left the class. I notice many of you moving around in your seats without pencils in your hands. You’re probably feeling a bit distracted. Let’s all take a minute to stand up at our desks and shake out our hands & feet.” CLOSING - 8 MINUTESINSTRUCTIONSHomework: Ask participants to identify students who show difficulty managing behaviors & often affect other students. These should not be the students who the educator has the most challenges with, but instead someone who falls in the middle. When practicing a new skill, it is usually helpful to do so in less intense scenarios before practicing in a higher stress environment. With the student(s) identified, find opportunities to practice the DNA process with them.

This means that we begin first by turning inward, identifying and responding to our own emotions in order to foster a space where others can do the same. Understanding ModelingOne powerful tool in teaching emotion regulation is modeling. Modeling is beneficial because it is relational, interactive, and doesn’t require any special lesson plans or additional class time. As educators, we can practice this regularly as a way to both teach emotion regulation as well as share in ways that allow us to be known by our students. We can do this in the moments we feel happy, frustrated, disappointed and anywhere in between. For example, if we get stuck in traffic on the way to school and arrive without time for our usual prep, we might say “I feel a little anxious because I was caught in traffic and wasn’t able to make the photocopies we were going to use this morning. I’m going to take a few moments to breathe while you all complete the do-now so that the rest of our time together can feel less frazzled.” Name your own feelings and connect them to behaviors regularly.Practice!In a small group, pick one feeling you brought with you to work this week & practice connecting it to a thought and/or behavior.Reframing PraiseIn addition to modeling, educators can also shift their framework.

A student may be suspended or recommended for expulsion if they: Unlawfully possessed, used, furnished, or been under the influence of a controlled substance, alcoholic beverage, or intoxicant (48900(c)) Unlawfully offered, arranged, or negotiated to sell a controlled substance, alcoholic beverage, or intoxicant (48900(d)) Possessed or used tobacco or tobacco products (48900(h)) Unlawfully possessed, offered, arranged, or negotiated to sell drug paraphernalia (48900(j)) For discipline cited above, a superintendent or principal may use their discretion to provide alternatives to suspension or expulsion that are designed to address the student’s specific behavior (48900(v)). Some school discretion While duplicative of aspects of the above section, this section is specific to expulsions and allows alternatives to expulsion. A student must be recommended for expulsion for the following act, unless an alternative means of correction would address the conduct: Unlawful possession of any controlled substance, except for the first offense of less than an ounce of marijuana (48915(a)(1)(C)) No school discretion This is considered one of the “Big 5” offenses where suspension is clearly required. A student must be immediately suspended and recommended for expulsion for the following act: Unlawfully selling a controlled substance (48915(c)(3)) Education code (48900.5) also states that suspensions should be imposed only when other interventions fail. Alternative interventions cited in education code include, but are not limited to: A conference between school personnel, the pupil’s parent or guardian, and the pupil. Referrals to the school counselor, psychologist, social worker, or other school support service personnel for case management and counseling. Referral for a comprehensive psychosocial or psychoeducational assessment, including for purposes of creating an IEP or 504 plan. Enrollment in a program for teaching prosocial behavior or", "creating an IEP or 504 plan. Enrollment in a program for teaching prosocial behavior or anger management.

Similarly, schools also use a Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) framework for organizing school-based approaches to emotional, behavioral and academic needs of the entire student population (Bruns et al., 2016; Fazel et al., 2014). Like the ACEs Aware clinical response framework, MTSS is organized across three tiers. Universal interventions are delivered to all students at Tier 1. Students who are identified as needing additional help receive targeted support at Tier 2. Those who continue to need support are provided with intensive, individualized, Tier 3 interventions (Bruns et al., 2016). 3 As part of their tiered clinical response, SBHCs are in a unique position to collaborate with schools to address various levels of students’ need for prevention and intervention. The examples below highlight the various ways that SBHC providers we spoke with coordinated care with schools across these tiers of support. Figure 1.

In schools, Tier 1 services include universal prevention and education for students, caregivers, and school staff. Clinical providers (both medical and mental health providers) are often invited to go into classrooms to provide outreach and information about available SBHC services and education on various health topics. Clinic staff have also led education and prevention groups for students in partnership with the school, including lessons on mindfulness, sleep, and nutrition. Students conduct projects for class related to these health topics. In one district, the clinic is made aware of the health topics covered on the academic calendar, and they coordinate their health education offerings so that students are learning about a similar topic in school and through the clinic. 3 See the ACEs Aware Overview: A Tiered Clinical Response Framework for Addressing Toxic Stress available at: https://www. acesaware.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/An-Overview-A-Tiered-Clinical-Response-Framework-for-Addressing-ToxicStress.pdf 18 • etr.org SBHC staff also provide professional development opportunities with school staff around ACEs and their impact on students and families. They have helped to establish calming corners in school classrooms. One clinic has also offered luncheons with school staff to provide ACEs education. SBHC mental health professionals will attend weekly teacher’s meetings to share some trends they are seeing with students and get information about what is happening in the school context. “During COVID, SBHC providers went into the classrooms... to talk to them about how to get services and talk to them a little bit about the impact of, I guess, I did that trauma informed stuff about, like, ‘This is really weird. I imagine for you guys at your age, this is a lot more stressful and strange and isolating.’” - SBHC Nurse Practitioner “I know that there was some education done for the school by the LCSWs talking about calming corners that they integrated into the schools as well as doing their own mini professional development on trauma-informed care to keep them up to date. What we started trying to do is [follow the district’s] calendar of health topics, usually every month or quarterly, so we try to mimic that so that kids are learning about something in school, they’re also learning about it in the health center... in the last two years, we’ve been able to do peer education groups. We have AmeriCorps interns as well as myself or a behavioral health clinician supporting the groups. This year, it’s with sixth graders and the peer education ...

That’s been really successful”. - SBHC Nurse Practitioner CURRENT PRACTICE Targeted interventions Tier 2 – Targeted Interventions. Tier 2 interventions are for individual students or groups of students identified as needing extra support beyond the universal prevention and strategies. Health educators, case managers, and/or clinical staff (both physical health and mental health staff) may follow-up with individual students or facilitate student groups on topics such as yoga and mindfulness, mental health, anxiety and other mental health issues, LGBTQ groups, and others. These groups can be coordinated in response to collective student needs for the prevention and treatment of toxic stress. “So all of the school counselors have my phone number and they’ll reach out like, “Hey, can you call me?” And I call and they’re like, “so and so is having a bad day today, do you have any extra time?” And if I do, I go over. If I don’t, then I typically make an appointment to go the very next day or follow up with them after school.” - Behavioral Health Provider CURRENT PRACTICE Intensive interventions Tier 3 – Intensive Interventions. In coordination with schools, Tier 3 interventions that extend beyond medical treatment typically involve co-located behavioral health services or referrals to external behavioral health providers. Some clinics do therapy sessions with students at the school, at their home, or through telehealth. One of the SBHCs we spoke with also sees patients that are not affiliated with the school – often for confidential family planning services through the Family PACT program. They have a taxi voucher system where they can transport students from other schools to the clinic to receive mental health counseling or birth control services. “I can only offer short term therapy. So roughly anywhere from 10 to less sessions, one to 10 sessions. And so, there’s young people who will come in and have very complex trauma and need, I feel clinically, they need long term services. And so, just having to connect with all these other agencies and seeing what is open, connecting to the access line, connecting with our behavioral health team to see if we have the capacity to take them on.

Crisis planning should not take place in the midst of an actual crisis. The following strategies support schools to quickly deescalate and respond to the needs of all impacted members of the community when a high impact event occurs • Create school mental health crisis planning & response team• Establish clear protocols & practices for before, during, and after • Identify psychologically vulnerable students and staff• Schedule exercises or drills• Annual training of staff on procedures, practices, policies, and protocols, as well as training and orientation of new staffSlide 6: Factors to consider when developing tiered plans for response to high impact events include: severity of the event, the number of individuals involved, and the type of high impact event that occurred. Slide 7: There are a number of variables that impact the likelihood of community members sustaining an acute post-traumatic stress response. These should be considered and attended to when developing school-wide plans for response and recovery. • Event predictability• Type of disaster (natural vs human made crisis)• Source of injury/threat (accident v assault)• Presence of fatalities• Quality of immediate response• Physical/Emotional proximity to the crisis event• Personal trauma history• Recency of other crises• Resources• Timing• Recovery (Debrief, time to tell one’s story, level of support)Slide 8: As participants begin to brainstorm policy and practice recommendations, attention should be paid to the following areas of impact: • Emotional• Cognitive• Physical• Relational• BehavioralINTERVENE - 5 MINUTESMATERIALS• Facilitator SlidesINSTRUCTIONSSlide 9: In the event that a crisis does occur, trauma-informed intervention seeks to re-establish safety and security while minimizing risk of harm to the individuals involved as well as bystanders.

Prevention occurs both indirectly (for example: building strong relationships with families and students; utilizing classroom management strategies that improve student sense of physical and emotional safety; developing trusting relationships with colleagues) and directly (for example: screening for possible mental health concerns; holding school conversations about specific behaviors or experiences; training all staff in trauma-informed practices). Examples of prevention practices arei. Universal trauma-informed school practicesii. Addressing specific topics that may lead to school crises (bullying, violence, fights, substance abuse, domestic violence, suicidality, depression)iii. Implementing Primary Prevention Models (PBIS, personalized learning, comprehensive school-based mental health)iv. Providing universal mental health screeningv.

Slide 7: There are a number of variables that impact the likelihood of community members sustaining an acute post-traumatic stress response. These should be considered and attended to when developing school-wide plans for response and recovery. • Event predictability• Type of disaster (natural vs human made crisis)• Source of injury/threat (accident v assault)• Presence of fatalities• Quality of immediate response• Physical/Emotional proximity to the crisis event• Personal trauma history• Recency of other crises• Resources• Timing• Recovery (Debrief, time to tell one’s story, level of support)Slide 8: As participants begin to brainstorm policy and practice recommendations, attention should be paid to the following areas of impact: •", "policy and practice recommendations, attention should be paid to the following areas of impact: • Emotional• Cognitive• Physical• Relational• BehavioralINTERVENE - 5 MINUTESMATERIALS• Facilitator SlidesINSTRUCTIONSSlide 9: In the event that a crisis does occur, trauma-informed intervention seeks to re-establish safety and security while minimizing risk of harm to the individuals involved as well as bystanders.

Rest your arms gently by your side. Scan your body slowly for areas of tension- areas of unrest or stress. Now bring your attention to your breathing- is it fast and labored? Maybe it is already slow and steady. Just take a moment to become aware. We will begin to focus our control on our breathing. Let’s do this three times. Breath in deep, and breath out, pushing the air through your nostrils. Breathe in, breathe out. Last time, breathe deeply, pulling the breath into your belly, feeling your ribcage expand. Now breath out, pushing the air up out of your lungs through your nostrils. Allow yourself to just breathe gently as we move through the next part of the exercise. If your mind starts to wander, that’s ok just notice it and return your focus to your in breath. Now let your legs and the soles of your feet descend as if they are the roots of a tree. Your feet extend deep into the ground. Now breathe up through the roots- move your breath from the soles of your feet, up through your calves, and thighs. Feel the breath move through your legs up to the core of your body. Let your tree grow up through your ribs and shoulders- with your outbreath, relax your arms and neck. Feel the in breath in your throat and let it expand into your head, relaxing your brain, your forehead, your thoughts. Imagine, with each in breath, you are extending the roots up to the crown of the head. Feel your energy move from the soles of your feet up through your head and into the sky. With your next in breath, feel the power of the earth move through the roots of your feet up through your stomach and heart, to the top of your head. With your outbreath, gently release this stress; let it go into the air, let it go into the sky. From the roots deep in the center of the earth, draw energy up to the crown of your head. If you get distracted just notice your thoughts then let them go. Accept your distraction then draw your attention back to the soles of your feet, your roots, strong and powerful. Notice your breath, notice the energy you draw from the core of the earth. There is abundant energy. As you breath out, let your stress and emotions escape into the atmosphere. Continue to breathe deeply. Pull the energy from the center of the earth, feel the energy move through you. Feel your outbreath releasing the tensions and worries you are carrying. You are encouraged to continue this breathing for several more moments. When you are ready, please start to shift your awareness back to the soles of your feet. Notice how the ground feels below your body. Notice the connection your feet have made with the earth.

Lack of emotion regulation is a developmental gap. In a child’s ideal development, emotion regulation is a skill learned both implicitly and explicitly. For some people who had highly attuned and regulated caregivers, strategies for emotion regulation were built simply by observing and replicating a caregiver modeling it. However, this is often not what happens either because a caregiver was unable to provide that attunement and/or because the caregiving occurred in a chronically stressful environment with little reprieve to practice it. Students who have a developmental trauma history likely did not intuitively develop this skill. It is important to remember that for most students if they can, they will--emotion dysregulation is uncomfortable. A lack of emotion regulation is a developmental gap that needs to be addressed just like any other gap in academic skills. 2. Our most important teaching tool are ourselves.Because many of us were not explicitly taught, we may not have a model for how to teach others. This can create anxiety, feelings of incompetence, etc. These feelings, if left unattended to, can lead to own dysregulation which can interact with students’ dysregulation. This back and forth dysregulation leaves us without a way to mindfully relate to one another. 3. Emotion regulation skills are necessary for learning Emotion regulation is necessary for the development of complex problem-solving skills, memory functioning, attention and focus, and making novel connections.

For the patient - Accurate, high-quality documentation can help support students’eligibility and qualifications for 504 or IEP plans, disability and as evidence formandated treatment, such as cases involving child protective services or thejudicial system. Systems such as “Open Notes” are also being used to maketreatment information more accessible to clients and to increase their participationin their own care. It is therefore important for the provider to be transparent andcollaborate with the student around sensitive information that could be included intheir notes, such as the results of any ACEs screening.2. For the treating clinician - To assist them in remembering relevant disclosuresand diagnostic formulations between visits. Additionally, for some clinicians, theprocess of writing and making decisions about the language and the wording ofthe documentation assists them in formulating clinical impressions and thoughtsabout treatment.3. For the treatment team – To enhance collaboration within multidisciplinary teamsand help other team members support and communicate about treatment goals.4. For the payer - To justify services and reimbursement.Beyond this, there are some important differences in how documentation is approachedin traditional behavioral health settings like a private clinician practice or specialty mentalhealth clinic and how it is approached in integrated behavioral health settings like FQHCs.In integrated settings:Less time is spent on documentation, in general. In integrated settings, the vast majorityof a clinician’s time is spent on patients, not documentation. Generally speaking, no morethan 10-15 minutes is spent on documentation for each patient seen.Documentation is focused where the patient is focused. Documentation requirementsdo not set the agenda for the visit. Instead, the patient’s needs and preferences shouldshape what is discussed; documentation follows. This is particularly important for youth,when engagement, trust and connection must succeed in the first session. This mayseem commonsensical; however, in many other behavioral health settings, the need tofollow standardized assessments or document the use of certain interventions oftendrives the session’s content.Documentation is more general when it comes to trauma and other sensitivesubjects. Shared electronic health records are a cornerstone of operational and clinicalintegration. When records are separated with confidential tabs or electronic firewalls,it is a barrier to collaborative whole-person care, both practically and philosophically.There are exceptions to this when circumstances require additional privacy within thechart to prevent release to parent/guardian. In both cases, because records are shared,behavioral health documentation in integrated settings is typically more general, briefand treatment-focused than documentation in traditional behavioral health settings. Asan example: “childhood trauma is endorsed; sexual abuse by grandfather” is a sufficientnote to put in the EHR, as opposed to a paragraph detailing the abuse’s frequency orseverity. Documentation should only consist of that which is medically necessary for thehealth team to know and what is relevant to support treatment planning.Blue = good clinical practiceRed = mandatory for payersPresenting problem: What the patient says they are there for.Example: “Patient reports they are here because the school nurse referred them, statesthey are unsure why” or “patient is with mom, who states presenting problem is concernabout depression and restrictive eating.”DiagnosisExample: Adjustment Disorder; Depression NOS (should be selected from a pick listbuilt in to EHR)Symptoms to Support DiagnosisExample: “Patient reports depressed mood, short term memory and concentrationimpairment, anhedonia and insomnia for the last 8 months.”Mental Status Exam: Commonly used on the first visit and in a structured cadence from that pointforward.

Follow up appointment in 2 weeks.”", "chunks": ["In integrated settings, all documentation for behavioral health services, includingsubstance use disorders, should be included within one shared electronic health record.This means no firewalls, “confidential” tab or other markers separating medical teamdocumentation and behavioral health documentation.Quality documentation is important in any setting for multiple reasons:1. For the patient - Accurate, high-quality documentation can help support students’eligibility and qualifications for 504 or IEP plans, disability and as evidence formandated treatment, such as cases involving child protective services or thejudicial system. Systems such as “Open Notes” are also being used to maketreatment information more accessible to clients and to increase their participationin their own care. It is therefore important for the provider to be transparent andcollaborate with the student around sensitive information that could be included intheir notes, such as the results of any ACEs screening.2. For the treating clinician - To assist them in remembering relevant disclosuresand diagnostic formulations between visits. Additionally, for some clinicians, theprocess of writing and making decisions about the language and the wording ofthe documentation assists them in formulating clinical impressions and thoughtsabout treatment.3. For the treatment team – To enhance collaboration within multidisciplinary teamsand help other team members support and communicate about treatment goals.4. For the payer - To justify services and reimbursement.Beyond this, there are some important differences in how documentation is approachedin traditional behavioral health settings like a private clinician practice or specialty mentalhealth clinic and how it is approached in integrated behavioral health settings like FQHCs.In integrated settings:Less time is spent on documentation, in general. In integrated settings, the vast majorityof a clinician’s time is spent on patients, not documentation. Generally speaking, no morethan 10-15 minutes is spent on documentation for each patient seen.Documentation is focused where the patient is focused. Documentation requirementsdo not set the agenda for the visit. Instead, the patient’s needs and preferences shouldshape what is discussed; documentation follows. This is particularly important for youth,when engagement, trust and connection must succeed in the first session. This mayseem commonsensical; however, in many other behavioral health settings, the need tofollow standardized assessments or document the use of certain interventions oftendrives the session’s content.Documentation is more general when it comes to trauma and other sensitivesubjects. Shared electronic health records are a cornerstone of operational and clinicalintegration. When records are separated with confidential tabs or electronic firewalls,it is a barrier to collaborative whole-person care, both practically and philosophically.There are exceptions to this when circumstances", "barrier to collaborative whole-person care, both practically and philosophically.There are exceptions to this when circumstances require additional privacy within thechart to prevent release to parent/guardian. In both cases, because records are shared,behavioral health documentation in integrated settings is typically more general, briefand treatment-focused than documentation in traditional behavioral health settings. Asan example: “childhood trauma is endorsed; sexual abuse by grandfather” is a sufficientnote to put in the EHR, as opposed to a paragraph detailing the abuse’s frequency orseverity. Documentation should only consist of that which is medically necessary for thehealth team to know and what is relevant to support treatment planning.Blue = good clinical practiceRed = mandatory for payersPresenting problem: What the patient says they are there for.Example: “Patient reports they are here because the school nurse referred them, statesthey are unsure why” or “patient is with mom, who states presenting problem is concernabout depression and restrictive eating.”DiagnosisExample: Adjustment Disorder; Depression NOS (should be selected from a pick listbuilt in to EHR)Symptoms to Support DiagnosisExample: “Patient reports depressed mood, short term memory and concentrationimpairment, anhedonia and insomnia for the last 8 months.”Mental Status Exam: Commonly used on the first visit and in a structured cadence from that pointforward.

As participants rotate through, consider the following questions: • If you are a classroom teacher--how can you build time for these in the structure of your class? This could be through a daily practice, integrating into existing curriculum, or changing the physical set up of your room. • If you work outside of the classroom--how can you support policies and procedures that directly address emotion regulation needs? • If you are on leadership, how can you advocate for school structures that both support teachers and the greater school community in teaching and modeling emotion regulation as a standard practice, not an individualized approach?Divide participants into up to six groups. Assign each group a starting location. Set a timer to go off every 7 minutes. When the timer goes off, ring a bell or give another signal for participants to rotate clockwise to the next station.

Sensory bins can be made from anything, but generally include a variety of textures/sensations for touch. Sensory bins are commonly made from kinetic sand and hard items such as shells, rocks, or miniature figurines. Next to the bin, set up single-serving candy and/or fruit. Grounding is a particular type of coping strategy that is designed to immediately connect you with the present moment. Grounding is often used as a way of coping with flashbacks or dissociation associated with PTSD. Grounding techniques often use the five senses—sound, touch, smell, taste, and sight—to immediately connect you with the here and now. For example, listening to certain songs, running hands under cold water, or chewing gum are all grounding techniques that produce sensations that are difficult to ignore and can be helpful distractions from distress. 1. With your team, play a game of “I Spy.” One person in the group, share your favorite color. Everybody--identify as many items as you can in that color around the room. 2. Using your sense of touch, spend time noticing what items in the sensory bin feel like. Are they warm or cold? Smooth or rough? Light or heavy? 3. Using all of your senses, taste a piece of candy or fruit. Before placing it in your mouth, notice its color, shape, size. Notice how it smells. Now place it in your mouth. Notice how it feels like on your tongue. Notice how it tastes.

When you experience a stressful event, your body automatically goes into survival mode. Your heart rate increases, your stomach stops digestion, and your breathing becomes more shallow.The goal of calming exercises is to get oneself from “flight, fight or freeze” mode back to a peaceful neutrality. Deep breathing helps get more oxygen into the bloodstream, opening up capillaries. It has a physical effect on your body to help you calm and lower stress by regulating the nervous system.Deep breathing does make a big difference. It is a tool that can be used anywhere, anytime!

The Pact: A shared understanding and agreement to tackle a specific goal. A formal agreement between teacher & student to work on a learning goal2. Teacher as Ally & Warm Demander: As part of their commitment, teacher acts as an ally to the student in their quest toward independent learning. The teacher offers care & push as needed with a skilled ability to push students into their zone of proximal development while helping them manage emotional responses so they don’t set off their amygdala.3. Student as Driver of Their Own Learning: For their part, the student commits to being an active participant in the process and takes ownership of learningGroup DiscussionWhat are the qualities of a teacher-student dynamic that indicate a strong alliance exists?

Begin with rapport building check-in.2. State explicitly the purpose of your meeting and affirming your belief in the student’s capacity as a learner. Provide evidence by citing progress and growth in other areas.3. Validate the student’s ability to master the learning target while acknowledging high demands of the task.4. Analyze the task together, identifying the easy and hard parts.5. Deliver feedback that is specific, actionable, and timely. Restate what the final goal is and what mastery looks like and then show them where they are in relationship to the goal.6. Create space for them to react to what they heard and how they feel about it.7. Provide specific actions to take to improve, and ways to track their progress.8. Ask them to paraphrase what they heard you say- what is wrong, what needs to be fixed, and how to go about fixing it.9. Offer emotional encouragement and restate your belief in them.10. Set up a time to follow-up and check progress.PracticeWith a partner, choose one person to act as the educator/mentor and the other as the student/mentee.

The Pact: A shared understanding and agreement to tackle a specific goal. A formal agreement between teacher & student to work on a learning goal2. Teacher as Ally & Warm Demander: As part of their commitment, teacher acts as an ally to the student in their quest toward independent learning. The teacher offers care & push as needed with a skilled ability to push students into their zone of proximal development while helping them manage emotional responses so they don’t set off their amygdala.3. Student as Driver of Their Own Learning: For their part, the student commits to being an active participant in the process and takes ownership of learningGroup DiscussionWhat are the qualities of a teacher-student dynamic that indicate a strong alliance exists? How does this differ from the rapport building stage?WARM DEMANDER - 10 MINUTESMATERIALS• Book: Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain• Warm Demander ChartINSTRUCTIONSWarm DemanderReferencing fig 6.2 on page 99 of Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain, instruct participants to spend time reading and reflecting on where they exist on the continuum. Ask educators to identify what parts of the four characters listed resonate for them. Pair ShareWith a partner, share responses to the Warm Demander reflection. 1. Where do you currently exist on this continuum?2. What do you feel is working well for you?3. Having had time to reflect and engage with this material--are there any ways you’d like to show up differently for students? Group DiscussionUse the following questions to guide full group discussion about building alliance through our style of relating. • Why do you need to use the trust generated in the rapport stage in the alliance stage? • How would you use it? • How do we validate students’ experience within the social-political context? ASSET-BASED FEEDBACK - 12 MINUTESMATERIALS• Learning Partnership HandoutINSTRUCTIONSProvide each participant with a copy of the Learning Partnership Handout. Instruct participants to identify 1-2 focal students from the list generated earlier in the workshop that they would like to prioritize over the next month. Group DiscussionHow do you balance", "that they would like to prioritize over the next month. Group DiscussionHow do you balance giving actionable, corrective feedback and affirming the student’s capacity without “soft peddling” the feedback?Asset-Based Feedback ProtocolReview Hammond’s Asset-Based Feedback Protocol found on the handout and on page 105 of “Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain”1. Begin with rapport building check-in.2. State explicitly the purpose of your meeting and affirming your belief in the student’s capacity as a learner. Provide evidence by citing progress and growth in other areas.3. Validate the student’s ability to master the learning target while acknowledging high demands of the task.4. Analyze the task together, identifying the easy and hard parts.5. Deliver feedback that is specific, actionable, and timely. Restate what the final goal is and what mastery looks like and then show them where they are in relationship to the goal.6. Create space for them to react to what they heard and how they feel about it.7. Provide specific actions to take to improve, and ways to track their progress.8. Ask them to paraphrase what they heard you say- what is wrong, what needs to be fixed, and how to go about fixing it.9. Offer emotional encouragement and restate your belief in them.10. Set up a time to follow-up and check progress.PracticeWith a partner, choose one person to act as the educator/mentor and the other as the student/mentee. The mentee will share their goal related to building a learning partnership with their identified focal student. The mentor will utilize the asset-based feedback protocol to support mentee in developing a clear plan to improve the learning partnership with their identified student. INVITING FEEDBACK - 5 MINUTESINSTRUCTIONSGroup DiscussionHow do students give you feedback? Do you consistently seek feedback? Why or why not?Ideas to engage students in feedback process include: Feedback jar, individual conferencing, eliciting feedback in the middle of a unit, reflection sheets CLOSING - 7 MINUTESINSTRUCTIONSCheck-OutAsk participants to “check-out” by identifying one action they will take this week in service of their learning partnership goal.

In the first column, the program name appears with a note that it is a planning grant. The second column explains that the goal is to establish new community schools and expand existing ones, with planning grants specifically available for school districts that do not yet have community schools; it states that grants can provide up to two hundred thousand dollars for two years and mentions an application deadline of April first for Cohort 1 and that Cohort 2 will open later. The third column lists the California Department of Education as the administering agency and states that sixteen point seven million dollars is available for the twenty-twenty-three to twenty-twenty-four funding cycle. The fourth column says that local education agencies, or LEAs, are eligible to apply. The fifth column gives the timeline as multiple funding cycles continuing through June twenty-thirty-one. The sixth column describes what activities are allowed to support new SBHCs: integrating SBHC planning into community-school development, providing staff time for planning work such as student needs assessments and coordination with health providers, establishing Memoranda of Understanding, and hiring consultants or technical assistance providers to create business and operating plans. It ends with the word “Non-allowable,” indicating that construction is not permitted under this program. The seventh column explains how the grant can support existing SBHCs by giving staff time for coordination, developing protocols for integrating school-based health centers into community schools, subcontracting with community clinics and other groups to deliver services, and contracting with an SBHC coordinator or manager to include them in the planning process; the column concludes with a list of prohibited activities such as using funds to replace existing funds, purchasing furniture, paying for leased facilities, or remodeling or building facilities. Under the table is a footnote defining a community school based on the California Department of Education and a link to schoolhealthcenters.org. This table presents detailed information about the California Community Schools Partnership Program (CCSPP) Implementation Grants, organized into seven labeled columns: Funding, Overall Goal or Intent, Agency and Total Funding Available, Who Can Apply or Access Funds, Timeline, Ways to Support New School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs), and Ways to Support Existing SBHCs. In the first column, the funding source is identified as the CCSPP Implementation Grants. The second column explains that the goal is to establish and expand community schools. Implementation grants support LEAs in starting new community schools or expanding existing ones, and continuing their operations. It states that the maximum award is five hundred thousand dollars per school per year for five years, that Cohort 1 applications were due April eleventh, twenty twenty-two, and that Cohort 2 applications will open in fall twenty twenty-two. The third column identifies the California Department of Education as the administering agency and notes that more funding will be available in future cohorts. It adds that Extension Grants will begin in the twenty twenty-five to twenty twenty-six fiscal year and will offer up to one hundred thousand dollars annually. The fourth column states that local education agencies, or LEAs, are eligible applicants. The fifth column shows the timeline as extending through June twenty thirty-one. The sixth column describes allowable uses of funds for supporting new SBHC sites. These include building coordination with healthcare partners during implementation; providing staff time for SBHC planning tasks such as assessing student and community needs, connecting with local health providers, and establishing Memoranda of Understanding; hiring consultants or technical assistance providers to create business and operating plans; and subcontracting with community partners to support early operations. The seventh column lists ways the funds can support existing SBHCs, including paying staff time to improve coordination of services and referrals; subcontracting with community clinics and other organizations to provide or coordinate health services; and increasing health services such as behavioral or oral health to meet identified needs. It ends with a list of non-allowable uses: replacing existing funding, buying furniture, leasing or purchasing facilities, or remodeling or constructing facilities. This table describes the “Evidence-Based and Community-Defined Practices Grants (CYBHI)” across seven columns: Funding, Overall Goal or Intent, Agency and Total Funding Available, Who Can Apply or Access Funds, Timeline, Ways to Support New School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs), and Ways to Support Existing SBHCs. The funding column lists the grant name. The goal column explains that the grant aims to improve access to critical behavioral-health interventions by scaling both evidence-based practices and community-defined practices, emphasizing effectiveness, racial-equity impact, and sustainability. The agency column states that the Department of Health Care Services administers the program and that a total of four hundred twenty-nine million dollars is available across six funding rounds. The eligibility column lists a wide range of applicants: community-based organizations, provider clinics, cities, counties, Family Resource Centers, early-learning providers, statewide and local agencies, faith-based organizations, local education agencies, higher-education institutions, tribal entities, and managed-care plans. The timeline column indicates that Rounds 1 through 3 are completed; Round 4 will fund youth-driven programs beginning August twenty-twenty-three; Round 5 will fund early-intervention programs also beginning August twenty-twenty-three; and Round 6 will focus on community-defined programs and practices, with details to be announced. The column on supporting new SBHCs states that funds may be used to improve access to training and certification for specific evidence-based practices and community-defined practices, and to provide start-up funds to implement those practices, especially those focused on prevention, early intervention, resilience, and recovery for children and youth, including a specific focus on Black, Indigenous, and other youth of color and LGBTQIA+ youth. The final column, supporting existing SBHCs, explains that funds may expand behavioral-health capacity through training for clinical and non-clinical staff in evidence-based or community-defined practices; support replication and adaptation of well-established behavioral-health practices such as CBITS or trauma-informed cognitive-behavioral therapy; and launch or expand non-clinical behavioral-health programs such as evidence-based peer-support models. This table describes the “Statewide Multi-Payer Fee Schedule for School-Linked Behavioral Health Services” across seven clearly labeled columns: Funding, Overall Goal or Intent, Agency and Total Funding Available, Who Can Apply or Access Funds, Timeline, Ways to Support New School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs), and Ways to Support Existing SBHCs. The funding column names the program. The goal column explains that its purpose is to expand access to school-linked behavioral health services by requiring Medi-Cal and commercial insurance plans to reimburse providers for services delivered to students, regardless of the provider’s network status. The agency column lists the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) and the Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) as overseers, with no set funding amount because it is a fee-for-service reimbursement structure rather than a fixed grant. The eligibility column states that local education agencies and institutions of higher education can enroll as school-linked network providers and may hire or contract with eligible behavioral-health practitioners. The timeline column describes a phased roll-out: Phase 1 begins January twenty twenty-four for early adopters; Phase 2 expands to a larger cohort in July twenty twenty-four; and beginning January twenty twenty-five, all LEAs, charter schools, and schools for the deaf or blind may opt in. The sixth column states that this funding mechanism does not apply to SBHC planning or construction, so there are no allowable uses for creating new sites. The final column details how existing SBHCs can use this reimbursement structure to expand services: they can increase behavioral-health capacity by billing for more services, supporting additional clinicians; receive reimbursement for contracted behavioral-health providers; bill for expanded activities, including Tier 2 interventions such as psychoeducation, care coordination, and screenings; receive Medi-Cal reimbursement for services delivered by non-clinical staff like community health workers and wellness coaches beginning in twenty twenty-five; and use increased billing revenue to strengthen long-term sustainability and staffing levels. This table presents detailed information about the “School-Linked Partnership and Capacity Building Grants” across seven labeled columns: Funding, Overall Goal or Intent, Agency and Total Funding Available, Who Can Apply or Access Funds, Timeline, Ways to Support New SBHCs, and Ways to Support Existing SBHCs. The first column names the funding source. The second column explains that the goal is to strengthen school-linked behavioral health services statewide and help California public K–12 schools prepare for the multi-payer school-linked fee schedule. The grant aims to expand provider capacity, develop partnerships, and build needed infrastructure. The third column states that the Department of Health Care Services administers the program and that four hundred million dollars is available for preschool through twelfth grade. The fourth column lists eligible applicants: local education agencies, health plans, community-based organizations, behavioral-health providers, county behavioral-health departments, and tribal entities. The fifth column states that funds will be allocated directly to County Offices of Education, which will then distribute them to LEAs. The sixth column describes how funds may support new School-Based Health Centers. It states that schools can conduct SBHC needs assessments to identify which sites would benefit from new health centers, and refers to the California School-Based Health Alliance’s “Student Health Index” as a tool. Funding can support staffing and operational costs for the first one to three years to build sustainable systems; it can also be used to build out physical space for behavioral-health services, open wellness centers, hire and train staff, implement evidence-based practices, create policies and procedures, and develop billing infrastructure. The seventh column details ways funds can strengthen existing SBHCs. It says schools may expand behavioral-health capacity by hiring clinicians and non-clinical staff, and by improving reimbursement and billing practices using the organization’s Behavioral Health Sustainability Guide. One-time funding may also be used to enhance non-clinical programs, such as peer-to-peer supports; provide school-staff trainings; support trauma-informed clinical and classroom practices; and add Tier 1 services like classroom education, stigma-reduction initiatives, and socio-emotional skills training. The column concludes by explaining that funds can also expand tele-behavioral-health services, using existing SBHCs as hubs and connecting additional schools via telehealth, with a reference to the resource “Telehealth in Schools and SBHCs.” This table describes the “Certified Wellness Coach Medi-Cal Provider Type” across seven clearly labeled columns: Funding, Overall Goal or Intent, Agency and Total Funding Available, Who Can Apply or Access Funds, Timeline, Ways to Support New SBHCs, and Ways to Support Existing SBHCs. The first column lists the funding source name. The second column explains the program’s purpose: to expand the capacity of the youth behavioral-health system by creating a new provider type called the Wellness Coach. These coaches will be a diverse workforce of individuals with lived experience who deliver non-clinical support to youth while receiving structured supervision, training, and exposure to behavioral-health fields. The third column identifies the administering agency as California’s Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI). It notes that HCAI has been allocated three hundred thirty-eight million dollars specifically to design and build the Wellness Coach model. There is no maximum grant amount because the program operates through reimbursable services once the provider type is active. The fourth column lists the eligible applicants: schools, school districts, community-based organizations, health-care partners, and government agencies. The fifth column states the timeline, explaining that the first cohort of Wellness Coaches will begin in the year twenty twenty-five. The sixth column, which covers support for new School-Based Health Centers, states that this funding mechanism is not relevant for SBHC planning or construction. The seventh column details how the provider type supports existing School-Based Health Centers. It says that SBHCs can receive Medi-Cal reimbursement for services delivered to eligible students by Wellness Coaches. It also explains that funds can support expanded services provided by non-licensed SBHC staff, including Tier 1 and Tier 2 supports such as wellness promotion, screening, care coordination, individual or group support, crisis support, and peer-program coordination. Finally, the column states that the initiative creates a workforce-development pathway by allowing SBHCs to hire Wellness Coaches as part of a behavioral-health career pipeline. This table describes the “Mental Health Student Services Act” using seven columns: Funding, Overall Goal or Intent, Agency and Total Funding Available, Who Can Apply or Access Funds, Timeline, Ways to Support New School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs), and Ways to Support Existing SBHCs. The first column names the funding source. The second column explains the goal: to promote partnerships between county mental-health agencies and local education agencies so they can jointly deliver school-based mental-health services to young people and their families. The third column identifies the administering agency as the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC). It notes that one hundred million dollars is available for Phase 3. The fourth column lists eligible applicants: county behavioral-health departments working in partnership with local education agencies. The fifth column states the timeline as “No current applications open,” meaning that future rounds are not yet announced. The sixth column outlines how funds may support the creation of new SBHC sites. It says schools can conduct needs assessments to determine which campuses would benefit from SBHCs, referencing the California School-Based Health Alliance’s “Student Health Index” as a tool. Funds may be used for facilities construction to increase access to behavioral-health services. They may also support staffing and operational costs for the first one to three years to help build sustainable systems and reimbursement processes. The column also notes that partnerships between LEAs, county behavioral-health agencies, and community providers can be funded to support SBHC planning and coordinated referral pathways. The seventh and final column describes how the program supports existing SBHCs. It states that schools can expand behavioral-health capacity by hiring clinicians and strengthening referral and billing systems using the Alliance’s Behavioral Health Sustainability Guide. The funding can also support one-time enhancements to non-clinical behavioral-health programs, including peer-to-peer support programs, staff trainings, trauma-informed clinical and classroom practices, and Tier 1 interventions such as classroom mental-health education, stigma reduction, and socio-emotional skills training. This table explains the “Federal Health Center Program Service Expansion: School-Based Service Sites” funding opportunity using seven columns: Funding, Overall Goal or Intent, Agency and Total Funding Available, Who Can Apply or Access Funds, Timeline, Ways to Support New SBHCs, and Ways to Support Existing SBHCs. The first column lists the funding program. The second column states the overall goal: to increase the number of patients who receive comprehensive primary health-care services by expanding service-delivery sites located at schools. The third column identifies the administering agency as the Bureau of Primary Health Care within the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). It lists the total funding available as thirty million dollars. The fourth column states that only federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) are eligible to apply. The fifth column gives the timeline as September twenty twenty-two through August twenty twenty-three, noting that the current grant cycle is completed. The sixth column describes how the funding supports new School-Based Health Centers—specifically, funding is for creating new SBHCs or expanding existing ones. It explains that previous applicants are funded first, after which a new round of funding is opened. It emphasizes that only FQHCs are eligible. It also lists ineligible activities: construction, facility purchase or land purchase, and major renovations. The seventh column explains how the program can support existing SBHCs. The rules are the same as for new sites: the funding can support new or expanded school-based sites, with priority given to prior applicants, and eligibility restricted to FQHCs. The same activities remain ineligible: construction, land or facility purchase, and major renovations. This table contains two separate funding programs, each described across seven columns: Funding, Overall Goal or Intent, Agency and Total Funding Available, Who Can Apply or Access Funds, Timeline, Ways to Support New School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs), and Ways to Support Existing SBHCs. The first row describes the Local Educational Agency Medi-Cal Billing Option Program (LEA-BOP). The funding column lists the program name and notes that it reimburses for services. The goal column explains that LEA-BOP reimburses school districts for health-related services already being provided to Medi-Cal-eligible students. It states that as of April 2020, districts—meaning LEAs—pay one hundred percent of service costs upfront and later get reimbursed. The agency column identifies the Department of Health Care Services as the administrator. The next column states that LEAs are the only eligible applicants. The timeline column says this is an ongoing funding stream and is most relevant for LEAs with a high population of Medi-Cal-insured students. The column on supporting new SBHCs explains that strong billing under LEA-BOP can fund staff positions more fully, freeing school funds and Local Control Funding Formula dollars to open or expand School-Based Health and Wellness Centers. The final column explains how LEA-BOP supports existing SBHCs: it can expand behavioral-health capacity by supporting the hiring of clinicians and by strengthening referral and billing processes needed to sustain new positions. A web link appears between the two major rows. The second row describes the Administrative Activities Program (SMAA), which reimburses administrative costs. The overall-goal column says SMAA has been improved by expanding eligibility for services and removing restrictions that previously prevented serving general-education students. The agency column notes that the program reimburses at the maximum federal rate, up to fifty percent, with approximately one hundred eighty million dollars available. The eligibility column specifies that only activities linked to eligible students qualify.", "chunks": ["This table describes one funding source, the California Community Schools Partnership Program (CCSPP) Planning Grants, using seven columns: Funding, Overall Goal or Intent, Agency and Total Funding Available, Who Can Apply or Access Funds, Timeline, Ways to Support New School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs), and Ways to Support Existing SBHCs.

The third column identifies the administering agency as the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC). It notes that one hundred million dollars is available for Phase 3. The fourth column lists eligible applicants: county behavioral-health departments working in partnership with local education agencies. The fifth column states the timeline as “No current applications open,” meaning that future rounds are not yet announced. The sixth column outlines how funds may support the creation of new SBHC sites. It says schools can conduct needs assessments to determine which campuses would benefit from SBHCs, referencing the California School-Based Health Alliance’s “Student Health Index” as a tool. Funds may be used for facilities construction to increase access to behavioral-health services. They may also support staffing and operational costs for the first one to three years to help build sustainable systems and reimbursement processes. The column also notes that partnerships between LEAs, county behavioral-health agencies, and community providers can be funded to support SBHC planning and coordinated referral pathways. The seventh and final column describes how the program supports existing SBHCs. It states that schools can expand behavioral-health capacity by hiring clinicians and strengthening referral and billing systems using the Alliance’s Behavioral Health Sustainability Guide. The funding can also support one-time enhancements to non-clinical behavioral-health programs, including peer-to-peer support programs, staff trainings, trauma-informed clinical and classroom practices, and Tier 1 interventions such as classroom mental-health education, stigma reduction, and socio-emotional skills training. This", "Tier 1 interventions such as classroom mental-health education, stigma reduction, and socio-emotional skills training. This table explains the “Federal Health Center Program Service Expansion: School-Based Service Sites” funding opportunity using seven columns: Funding, Overall Goal or Intent, Agency and Total Funding Available, Who Can Apply or Access Funds, Timeline, Ways to Support New SBHCs, and Ways to Support Existing SBHCs. The first column lists the funding program. The second column states the overall goal: to increase the number of patients who receive comprehensive primary health-care services by expanding service-delivery sites located at schools. The third column identifies the administering agency as the Bureau of Primary Health Care within the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). It lists the total funding available as thirty million dollars. The fourth column states that only federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) are eligible to apply. The fifth column gives the timeline as September twenty twenty-two through August twenty twenty-three, noting that the current grant cycle is completed. The sixth column describes how the funding supports new School-Based Health Centers—specifically, funding is for creating new SBHCs or expanding existing ones. It explains that previous applicants are funded first, after which a new round of funding is opened. It emphasizes that only FQHCs are eligible. It also lists ineligible activities: construction, facility purchase or land purchase, and major renovations. The seventh column explains how the program can support existing SBHCs. The rules are the same as for new sites: the funding can support new or expanded school-based sites, with priority given to prior applicants, and eligibility restricted to FQHCs. The same activities remain ineligible: construction, land or facility purchase, and major renovations. This table contains two separate funding programs, each described across seven columns: Funding, Overall Goal or Intent, Agency and Total Funding Available, Who Can Apply or Access Funds, Timeline, Ways to Support New School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs), and Ways to Support Existing SBHCs. The first row describes the Local Educational Agency Medi-Cal Billing Option Program (LEA-BOP). The funding column lists the program name and notes that it reimburses for services. The goal column explains that LEA-BOP reimburses school districts for health-related services already being provided to Medi-Cal-eligible students. It states that as of April 2020, districts—meaning LEAs—pay one hundred percent of service costs upfront and later get reimbursed. The agency column identifies the Department of Health Care Services as the administrator. The next column states", "column identifies the Department of Health Care Services as the administrator. The next column states that LEAs are the only eligible applicants. The timeline column says this is an ongoing funding stream and is most relevant for LEAs with a high population of Medi-Cal-insured students. The column on supporting new SBHCs explains that strong billing under LEA-BOP can fund staff positions more fully, freeing school funds and Local Control Funding Formula dollars to open or expand School-Based Health and Wellness Centers. The final column explains how LEA-BOP supports existing SBHCs: it can expand behavioral-health capacity by supporting the hiring of clinicians and by strengthening referral and billing processes needed to sustain new positions. A web link appears between the two major rows. The second row describes the Administrative Activities Program (SMAA), which reimburses administrative costs. The overall-goal column says SMAA has been improved by expanding eligibility for services and removing restrictions that previously prevented serving general-education students. The agency column notes that the program reimburses at the maximum federal rate, up to fifty percent, with approximately one hundred eighty million dollars available. The eligibility column specifies that only activities linked to eligible students qualify."]}, "heading_number": 4, "subheading_number": null, "heading_page_number": 4, "excerpt": "<p>The text provides detailed descriptions of multiple California funding programs aimed at supporting the development and expansion of School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) and behavioral health services in schools.

{"section_uuid": "f5a1e673-c1a9-4714-8d4a-d8d98fe69795", "title": "How the Model Is Unique", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Navigating-the-Promise-of-SBHCs.pdf", "content": {"full_text": "This section addresses some of the many ways SBHCs differ from other pediatric and teen health care settings: SBHCs are smaller than typical community-based health centers. Most SBHCs are physically small (1-3 exam rooms) and have less than one full-time medical practitioner working in them. (This ranges from 0.2 FTE to 2.0 or more medical providers.) The service mix varies. For example, in a typical community health center, there might be one behavioral health clinician for every four medical providers, whereas SBHCs might have more behavioral health than primary care FTE. In general, school communities find that it is beneficial to maximize behavioral health services availability, and maintain at least a 1:1 ratio of behavioral health to medical provider time. While the medical needs of a population of 1,000+ adolescents can usually be addressed by a 1.0 FTE nurse practitioner or physician assistant, behavioral health needs are much more time-intensive. It is also recommended to have a high ratio of health education staff given the many opportunities for health promotion, counseling, teaching, and motivational interviewing. SBHCs address many social determinants of health and education. Going back to their origins, SBHCs have always supported young people in ways that were holistic, not strictly clinical, acknowledging the ways that factors like hunger, school failure, and dating violence impacted student health and well-being. SBHCs operate peer health education programs, conduct classroom education, and connect students to employment services and youth development programs in their communities that support social connection. Some SBHCs host school supply giveaways and food distribution, many operate peer mentorship or peer health education programs, others host medical legal partnerships, and still others offer groups for new immigrants, young men of color, and/or girls' empowerment. Because of both proximity and collaboration with school, students often walk into their school-based health centers seeking support they might be reluctant to request from a community-based medical center or mental health program. SBHC staff accept this challenge and go “outside the clinic walls” to support adolescent autonomy, health, and well-being. SBHCs also help promote developmental assets (positive supports and strengths that young people need to succeed) such as a caring school environment, positive adult relationships, and demonstrating that the community values youth. Staffing needs vary. Because SBHCs are small, their staff care teams are often less specialized than those working in larger health centers. For example, larger community-based clinics may employ medical records personnel, referrals staff, a call center, and/or billers, not to mention dedicated nurse case managers that support a number of primary care providers. SBHCs are more likely to have a few staff who play multiple roles – e.g., a medical assistant that also handles referrals and medical records, and a receptionist/clerk who does billing and insurance enrollment. There are more collaborative relationships to navigate. At a minimum, SBHC operators – assuming they are not run by the school district itself – will need to work in close collaboration with the host school and school district. Schools often have many other service providers on campus, so those entities are also important partners – this includes after-school programs, Family Resource Centers, and other mental health providers working with special populations. (See more on coordinating services below.) In part because of the relationships described above, SBHCs typically require a higher ratio of management to provider FTE than other centers. SBHCs lack the assembly line efficiencies or economies of scale, are intrinsically complex, and benefit from an administrator who is very skilled at nurturing trusted relationships for the school and parent community. Parents and guardians are often not present for their children’s care. The beauty of the model is that caregivers can authorize consent at the beginning of a school year or enrollment and then children can independently access the care for which consent was provided. This means less transportation burdens and interference with work for families and caregivers. This facilitates easy access but can also complicate some aspects of the care. For example, children and youth often cannot give a thorough medical history; discussions about vaccines, specialty referrals and other decisions or follow-up take coordination with parents/caregivers through collateral visits by phone, video and sometimes in person. Lack of a clearly defined model. Unlike some other provider types (such as FQHCs, free clinics, and/or tribal clinics), there are no statutes in California governing SBHCs. SBHCs therefore follow various licensing and regulatory rules depending on their lead agency and other factors such as how many hours per week they operate. Unlike other states, SBHCs are not required to submit any consistent data that is centered on the model or the needs of children and youth. Site visits to ensure quality are not consistently performed and therefore there is abundant variation and diversity across sites. In addition, related concepts like “school wellness center” (see text box at right) can introduce more complexity and variation, and sometimes centers that appear to be SBHCs are opened with non-SBHC names. It is difficult in this context to promote clarity and understanding about SBHCs in California. The term “wellness center” has become popular in recent years but is used inconsistently across California. Most often it is used to refer to a center run by an LEA (local educational agency) with a primary focus on behavioral health and no onsite physical health services. It’s hard to control an SBHC’s payer mix. The SBHC model works best with an open door policy that allows all students to access services. This is in contrast to other settings that are often focused on patients with a particular health insurance/payer – e.g., a closed system like Kaiser Permanente or clinics that have members assigned by Medi-Cal managed care plans. While this approach is a deliberate way to encourage children and teens to utilize the primary and preventive care services, it can mean there are many services provided without a payer source – e.g., when a student with Kaiser coverage chooses to use their SBHC for a comprehensive sports physical. (One promising future development will be the state’s development of a Statewide School-linked Fee Schedule for all payers, due to be implemented by 2024.) Limited hours of operation. For budgetary reasons and because client volume is limited by the school size, some SBHCs operate for as little as one day each week. Many are closed during school breaks and summers, making arrangements for continuity of care via their lead agency or other community partners. Less predictable operating schedules. School environments are quite different from health care settings. SBHC operations are interrupted by events like assemblies, fire drills, exams and state testing, school lockdowns, pep rallies, field trips, and professional development days. These disruptions are common and can disable the SBHC for hours or days at a time. With a small number of providers, an entire clinic shift can be impacted by the nurse practitioner responding to a medical emergency on the football field or in the classroom, or the social worker coordinating a 5150 psychiatric hold and consult. At La Clínica de La Raza, a large FQHC based in Oakland that operates 8 SBHCs, productivity standards are approached differently than in other primary care clinics. Providers working at La Clínica’s non-SBHC sites are given 20% follow-up time to complete charting, coordination of care, quality improvement, and other patient care related duties. SBHC providers are expected to include their follow-up time in their regular shift s but see fewer patients in each scheduled hour. This pace, and the frequency of no-shows and unexpected interruptions, amounts to a similar overall number of patients per FTE per year as FQHC national standards: 2,100 for non-physician practitioners (NP, PA and CNM) and 4,200 for physicians. Standard measures of provider productivity are likely to be lower than in other settings. Most outpatient health practices operate based on underlying principles of how many clients/patients can be seen throughout a clinical shift in order to balance operating revenue, access, and clinical quality. These standards should be based on reasonable expectations that allow good relationship-building, respect, and clinical quality, even if hurried clinicians sometimes feel otherwise. However, standards set for good outpatient practices do not always translate well to SBHCs because of: (1) a less predictable operating environment (see above); (2) constant turnover of patient population; (3) caregivers not present (see above); and (4) most care focused on prevention and wellness, which involves ample screening, counseling, anticipatory guidance, and conversation, with very few procedures or “expedited” visits. SBHC providers may need to spend relatively more of their total work time building trust and relationships, not just with student clients but also with families and school staff. While no formal standards exist at a state or national level, CSHA suggests the following based on best practices collected from SBHCs over the years: medical providers can see about 2 patients per hour at most in an SBHC setting behavioral health clinicians can see an average of 4-6 clients per day dental providers/teams can see 15-18 patients per day As a result of many of the factors described above – low productivity, frequent closures, more management time, and few economies of scale - health insurance reimbursement alone is often insufficient to cover the full costs of providing high-quality SBHC care. In addition, most SBHCs do not charge patients/families for non-reimbursable care. And in general, staff spend a higher proportion of their time in non-reimbursable activities such as group education, outreach, crisis management, etc. Incomplete local control. SBHCs are “guests” on a school campus, which means lead agencies are subject to at least some of the school’s policies and procedures. This means staff need to be respectful of school rules like hall passes, visitor policies, and being intentional about how and when to pull students from class. Many SBHCs wanted to keep their doors open during the early months of the COVID pandemic, but had to follow district closures. Venice Family Clinic, which operates three SBHCs in the Los Angeles area, has found that doing facilities work such as implementing a data network for EHR access has been challenging. Lead agencies need to know who owns the equipment at the SBHC, where to go for repairs, and know that the timeline for making these kinds of changes might be very different than what they expect. This is often learned when planning and constructing a new SBHC where multiple players can slow the process significantly. There can be controversies. In California, there are laws to support a young person accessing confidential and/or sensitive services, known as California Minor Consent and Confidentiality Laws. Even with this law, concerns may surface about children and teens independently accessing health care services – especially ones like family planning, mental health, or even immunizations. Schools and the education sector have different rules about information-sharing than health care providers. Schools are governed by a federal law called FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) that differs quite significantly from HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and other health care laws. In California, minors are legally permitted to access a variety of health care services during the school day without parent/guardian consent; however, schools are responsible for what happens to students on the school campus and are accustomed to knowing everything about what happens to students while there. Accustomed to operating with full information about students, administrators can become frustrated when they are not informed of things like mental health emergencies, child abuse reports, pregnancies, and/or students using substances on campus. These issues can be challenging in any setting serving adolescents but can be particularly thorny in SBHCs. The next section includes suggestions for how to increase clarity, partnership and collaboration to address these very challenges.", "chunks": ["This section addresses some of the many ways SBHCs differ from other pediatric and teen health care settings: SBHCs are smaller than typical community-based health centers.

In California, minors are legally permitted to access a variety of health care services during the school day without parent/guardian consent; however, schools are responsible for what happens to students on the school campus and are accustomed to knowing everything about what happens to students while there. Accustomed to operating with full information about students, administrators can become frustrated when they are not informed of things like mental health emergencies, child abuse reports, pregnancies, and/or students using substances on campus. These issues can be challenging in any setting serving adolescents but can be particularly thorny in SBHCs. The next section includes suggestions for how to increase clarity, partnership and collaboration to address these very challenges."]}, "heading_number": 4, "subheading_number": null, "heading_page_number": 5, "excerpt": "<p>School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) differ from typical pediatric and community health settings by being smaller, offering a higher ratio of behavioral health services, and addressing social determinants of health through holistic, school-integrated care. They face unique challenges such as limited hours, unpredictable schedules, complex collaboration with schools, and funding constraints due to low productivity and non-reimbursable activities. Additionally, SBHCs navigate legal and confidentiality issues distinct from traditional healthcare settings, requiring strong partnerships with schools and families to effectively support adolescent health and well-being.</p>", "section_parent_heading_uuid": null}
