In the first column, the program name appears with a note that it is a planning grant. The second column explains that the goal is to establish new community schools and expand existing ones, with planning grants specifically available for school districts that do not yet have community schools; it states that grants can provide up to two hundred thousand dollars for two years and mentions an application deadline of April first for Cohort 1 and that Cohort 2 will open later. The third column lists the California Department of Education as the administering agency and states that sixteen point seven million dollars is available for the twenty-twenty-three to twenty-twenty-four funding cycle. The fourth column says that local education agencies, or LEAs, are eligible to apply. The fifth column gives the timeline as multiple funding cycles continuing through June twenty-thirty-one. The sixth column describes what activities are allowed to support new SBHCs: integrating SBHC planning into community-school development, providing staff time for planning work such as student needs assessments and coordination with health providers, establishing Memoranda of Understanding, and hiring consultants or technical assistance providers to create business and operating plans. It ends with the word “Non-allowable,” indicating that construction is not permitted under this program. The seventh column explains how the grant can support existing SBHCs by giving staff time for coordination, developing protocols for integrating school-based health centers into community schools, subcontracting with community clinics and other groups to deliver services, and contracting with an SBHC coordinator or manager to include them in the planning process; the column concludes with a list of prohibited activities such as using funds to replace existing funds, purchasing furniture, paying for leased facilities, or remodeling or building facilities. Under the table is a footnote defining a community school based on the California Department of Education and a link to schoolhealthcenters.org.

In the first column, the funding source is identified as the CCSPP Implementation Grants. The second column explains that the goal is to establish and expand community schools. Implementation grants support LEAs in starting new community schools or expanding existing ones, and continuing their operations. It states that the maximum award is five hundred thousand dollars per school per year for five years, that Cohort 1 applications were due April eleventh, twenty twenty-two, and that Cohort 2 applications will open in fall twenty twenty-two. The third column identifies the California Department of Education as the administering agency and notes that more funding will be available in future cohorts. It adds that Extension Grants will begin in the twenty twenty-five to twenty twenty-six fiscal year and will offer up to one hundred thousand dollars annually. The fourth column states that local education agencies, or LEAs, are eligible applicants. The fifth column shows the timeline as extending through June twenty thirty-one. The sixth column describes allowable uses of funds for supporting new SBHC sites. These include building coordination with healthcare partners during implementation; providing staff time for SBHC planning tasks such as assessing student and community needs, connecting with local health providers, and establishing Memoranda of Understanding; hiring consultants or technical assistance providers to create business and operating plans; and subcontracting with community partners to support early operations. The seventh column lists ways the funds can support existing SBHCs, including paying staff time to improve coordination of services and referrals; subcontracting with community clinics and other organizations to provide or coordinate health services; and increasing health services such as behavioral or oral health to meet identified needs. It ends with a list of non-allowable uses: replacing existing funding, buying furniture, leasing or purchasing facilities, or remodeling or constructing facilities. This table describes the “Evidence-Based and Community-Defined Practices Grants (CYBHI)” across seven columns: Funding, Overall Goal or Intent, Agency and Total Funding Available, Who Can Apply or Access Funds, Timeline, Ways to Support New School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs), and Ways to Support Existing SBHCs. The funding column lists the grant name. The goal column explains that the grant aims to improve access to critical behavioral-health interventions by scaling both evidence-based practices and community-defined practices, emphasizing effectiveness, racial-equity impact, and sustainability. The agency column states that the Department of Health Care Services administers the program and that a total of four hundred twenty-nine million dollars is available across six funding rounds. The eligibility column lists a wide range of applicants: community-based organizations, provider clinics, cities, counties, Family Resource Centers, early-learning providers, statewide and local agencies, faith-based organizations, local education agencies, higher-education institutions, tribal entities, and managed-care plans. The timeline column indicates that Rounds 1 through 3 are completed; Round 4 will fund youth-driven programs beginning August twenty-twenty-three; Round 5 will fund early-intervention programs also beginning August twenty-twenty-three; and Round 6 will focus on community-defined programs and practices, with details to be announced. The column on supporting new SBHCs states that funds may be used to improve access to training and certification for specific evidence-based practices and community-defined practices, and to provide start-up funds to implement those practices, especially those focused on prevention, early intervention, resilience, and recovery for children and youth, including a specific focus on Black, Indigenous, and other youth of color and LGBTQIA+ youth. The final column, supporting existing SBHCs, explains that funds may expand behavioral-health capacity through training for clinical and non-clinical staff in evidence-based or community-defined practices; support replication and adaptation of well-established behavioral-health practices such as CBITS or trauma-informed cognitive-behavioral therapy; and launch or expand non-clinical behavioral-health programs such as evidence-based peer-support models. This table describes the “Statewide Multi-Payer Fee Schedule for School-Linked Behavioral Health Services” across seven clearly labeled columns: Funding, Overall Goal or Intent, Agency and Total Funding Available, Who Can Apply or Access Funds, Timeline, Ways to Support New School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs), and Ways to Support Existing SBHCs. The funding column names the program. The goal column explains that its purpose is to expand access to school-linked behavioral health services by requiring Medi-Cal and commercial insurance plans to reimburse providers for services delivered to students, regardless of the provider’s network status. The agency column lists the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) and the Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) as overseers, with no set funding amount because it is a fee-for-service reimbursement structure rather than a fixed grant. The eligibility column states that local education agencies and institutions of higher education can enroll as school-linked network providers and may hire or contract with eligible behavioral-health practitioners. The timeline column describes a phased roll-out: Phase 1 begins January twenty twenty-four for early adopters; Phase 2 expands to a larger cohort in July twenty twenty-four; and beginning January twenty twenty-five, all LEAs, charter schools, and schools for the deaf or blind may opt in. The sixth column states that this funding mechanism does not apply to SBHC planning or construction, so there are no allowable uses for creating new sites. The final column details how existing SBHCs can use this reimbursement structure to expand services: they can increase behavioral-health capacity by billing for more services, supporting additional clinicians; receive reimbursement for contracted behavioral-health providers; bill for expanded activities, including Tier 2 interventions such as psychoeducation, care coordination, and screenings; receive Medi-Cal reimbursement for services delivered by non-clinical staff like community health workers and wellness coaches beginning in twenty twenty-five; and use increased billing revenue to strengthen long-term sustainability and staffing levels. This table presents detailed information about the “School-Linked Partnership and Capacity Building Grants” across seven labeled columns: Funding, Overall Goal or Intent, Agency and Total Funding Available, Who Can Apply or Access Funds, Timeline, Ways to Support New SBHCs, and Ways to Support Existing SBHCs. The first column names the funding source. The second column explains that the goal is to strengthen school-linked behavioral health services statewide and help California public K–12 schools prepare for the multi-payer school-linked fee schedule. The grant aims to expand provider capacity, develop partnerships, and build needed infrastructure. The third column states that the Department of Health Care Services administers the program and that four hundred million dollars is available for preschool through twelfth grade. The fourth column lists eligible applicants: local education agencies, health plans, community-based organizations, behavioral-health providers, county behavioral-health departments, and tribal entities. The fifth column states that funds will be allocated directly to County Offices of Education, which will then distribute them to LEAs. The sixth column describes how funds may support new School-Based Health Centers. It states that schools can conduct SBHC needs assessments to identify which sites would benefit from new health centers, and refers to the California School-Based Health Alliance’s “Student Health Index” as a tool. Funding can support staffing and operational costs for the first one to three years to build sustainable systems; it can also be used to build out physical space for behavioral-health services, open wellness centers, hire and train staff, implement evidence-based practices, create policies and procedures, and develop billing infrastructure. The seventh column details ways funds can strengthen existing SBHCs. It says schools may expand behavioral-health capacity by hiring clinicians and non-clinical staff, and by improving reimbursement and billing practices using the organization’s Behavioral Health Sustainability Guide. One-time funding may also be used to enhance non-clinical programs, such as peer-to-peer supports; provide school-staff trainings; support trauma-informed clinical and classroom practices; and add Tier 1 services like classroom education, stigma-reduction initiatives, and socio-emotional skills training. The column concludes by explaining that funds can also expand tele-behavioral-health services, using existing SBHCs as hubs and connecting additional schools via telehealth, with a reference to the resource “Telehealth in Schools and SBHCs.” This table describes the “Certified Wellness Coach Medi-Cal Provider Type” across seven clearly labeled columns: Funding, Overall Goal or Intent, Agency and Total Funding Available, Who Can Apply or Access Funds, Timeline, Ways to Support New SBHCs, and Ways to Support Existing SBHCs. The first column lists the funding source name. The second column explains the program’s purpose: to expand the capacity of the youth behavioral-health system by creating a new provider type called the Wellness Coach. These coaches will be a diverse workforce of individuals with lived experience who deliver non-clinical support to youth while receiving structured supervision, training, and exposure to behavioral-health fields. The third column identifies the administering agency as California’s Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI). It notes that HCAI has been allocated three hundred thirty-eight million dollars specifically to design and build the Wellness Coach model. There is no maximum grant amount because the program operates through reimbursable services once the provider type is active. The fourth column lists the eligible applicants: schools, school districts, community-based organizations, health-care partners, and government agencies. The fifth column states the timeline, explaining that the first cohort of Wellness Coaches will begin in the year twenty twenty-five. The sixth column, which covers support for new School-Based Health Centers, states that this funding mechanism is not relevant for SBHC planning or construction. The seventh column details how the provider type supports existing School-Based Health Centers. It says that SBHCs can receive Medi-Cal reimbursement for services delivered to eligible students by Wellness Coaches. It also explains that funds can support expanded services provided by non-licensed SBHC staff, including Tier 1 and Tier 2 supports such as wellness promotion, screening, care coordination, individual or group support, crisis support, and peer-program coordination. Finally, the column states that the initiative creates a workforce-development pathway by allowing SBHCs to hire Wellness Coaches as part of a behavioral-health career pipeline. This table describes the “Mental Health Student Services Act” using seven columns: Funding, Overall Goal or Intent, Agency and Total Funding Available, Who Can Apply or Access Funds, Timeline, Ways to Support New School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs), and Ways to Support Existing SBHCs. The first column names the funding source. The second column explains the goal: to promote partnerships between county mental-health agencies and local education agencies so they can jointly deliver school-based mental-health services to young people and their families. The third column identifies the administering agency as the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC). It notes that one hundred million dollars is available for Phase 3. The fourth column lists eligible applicants: county behavioral-health departments working in partnership with local education agencies. The fifth column states the timeline as “No current applications open,” meaning that future rounds are not yet announced. The sixth column outlines how funds may support the creation of new SBHC sites. It says schools can conduct needs assessments to determine which campuses would benefit from SBHCs, referencing the California School-Based Health Alliance’s “Student Health Index” as a tool. Funds may be used for facilities construction to increase access to behavioral-health services. They may also support staffing and operational costs for the first one to three years to help build sustainable systems and reimbursement processes. The column also notes that partnerships between LEAs, county behavioral-health agencies, and community providers can be funded to support SBHC planning and coordinated referral pathways. The seventh and final column describes how the program supports existing SBHCs. It states that schools can expand behavioral-health capacity by hiring clinicians and strengthening referral and billing systems using the Alliance’s Behavioral Health Sustainability Guide. The funding can also support one-time enhancements to non-clinical behavioral-health programs, including peer-to-peer support programs, staff trainings, trauma-informed clinical and classroom practices, and Tier 1 interventions such as classroom mental-health education, stigma reduction, and socio-emotional skills training. This table explains the “Federal Health Center Program Service Expansion: School-Based Service Sites” funding opportunity using seven columns: Funding, Overall Goal or Intent, Agency and Total Funding Available, Who Can Apply or Access Funds, Timeline, Ways to Support New SBHCs, and Ways to Support Existing SBHCs.

It lists the total funding available as thirty million dollars. The fourth column states that only federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) are eligible to apply. The fifth column gives the timeline as September twenty twenty-two through August twenty twenty-three, noting that the current grant cycle is completed. The sixth column describes how the funding supports new School-Based Health Centers—specifically, funding is for creating new SBHCs or expanding existing ones. It explains that previous applicants are funded first, after which a new round of funding is opened. It emphasizes that only FQHCs are eligible. It also lists ineligible activities: construction, facility purchase or land purchase, and major renovations. The seventh column explains how the program can support existing SBHCs. The rules are the same as for new sites: the funding can support new or expanded school-based sites, with priority given to prior applicants, and eligibility restricted to FQHCs. The same activities remain ineligible: construction, land or facility purchase, and major renovations. This table contains two separate funding programs, each described across seven columns: Funding, Overall Goal or Intent, Agency and Total Funding Available, Who Can Apply or Access Funds, Timeline, Ways to Support New School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs), and Ways to Support Existing SBHCs. The first row describes the Local Educational Agency Medi-Cal Billing Option Program (LEA-BOP). The funding column lists the program name and notes that it reimburses for services. The goal column explains that LEA-BOP reimburses school districts for health-related services already being provided to Medi-Cal-eligible students. It states that as of April 2020, districts—meaning LEAs—pay one hundred percent of service costs upfront and later get reimbursed. The agency column identifies the Department of Health Care Services as the administrator. The next column states that LEAs are the only eligible applicants. The timeline column says this is an ongoing funding stream and is most relevant for LEAs with a high population of Medi-Cal-insured students. The column on supporting new SBHCs explains that strong billing under LEA-BOP can fund staff positions more fully, freeing school funds and Local Control Funding Formula dollars to open or expand School-Based Health and Wellness Centers. The final column explains how LEA-BOP supports existing SBHCs: it can expand behavioral-health capacity by supporting the hiring of clinicians and by strengthening referral and billing processes needed to sustain new positions. A web link appears between the two major rows. The second row describes the Administrative Activities Program (SMAA), which reimburses administrative costs. The overall-goal column says SMAA has been improved by expanding eligibility for services and removing restrictions that previously prevented serving general-education students. The agency column notes that the program reimburses at the maximum federal rate, up to fifty percent, with approximately one hundred eighty million dollars available.

Although every community is unique, there are some general organizational types that are most common and relevant for school health. The health care providers that deliver most health care for lower-income Californians with Medi-Cal or limited/no health insurance are collectively referred to as the health care “safety net.” These organizations often specialize in providing care for populations that face practical, cultural, and/or language barriers to accessing affordable, high-quality health care services. Health care staff often reflect the population served minimizing cultural and language barriers. Safety net providers are generally not-for-profit or public entities that often have access to specific health-related grants and funding streams that can support school-based, school-linked and other “place-based” services for specific populations. The table below depicts some of the most common health care provider types in California with core features that may be helpful for schools to understand, with a focus on the health care safety net. This table describes three types of health organizations by explaining what they are, what they exist to do, what services they typically provide, who they primarily serve, how they are funded, and what schools should consider when working with them. Community Health Centers are private or public nonprofit clinics governed by community boards that provide primary care, behavioral health for mild-to-moderate needs, dental care, lab and pharmacy services, enabling services like transportation and outreach, and health education to low-income and uninsured people; they are funded mostly by Medi-Cal and Medi-Cal managed care reimbursement with some federal and state grants, and they align well with school-based health centers but require high clinical volume and careful coordination, especially for students with commercial insurance. Local Health Departments are government-run agencies in all California counties and select cities that handle disease prevention, outbreak response, and public health emergencies; their services vary widely and may include vaccinations, HIV/STI services, home visits, and in some cases primary care, and they serve the entire local population with a focus on health disparities; they are funded mainly through population-based state allocations and various grants, and they align well with schools because of their population-health orientation though they can be slower due to government processes. Community Mental Health Agencies are mostly private community providers offering mental health and substance use services such as therapy, psychiatry, crisis intervention, case management, and wraparound support to low-income individuals with moderate-to-severe mental health needs; they are funded through contracts with local Mental Health Plans for Medi-Cal services and already partner with many school districts to deliver services on campuses.

County Mental Health Departments are government-operated agencies responsible for delivering specialty mental health services to people who meet medical-necessity criteria; their typical services include assessment, therapy, intensive case management, crisis response, and related mental health supports; they serve students only when the student qualifies for Related Mental Health Services under Special Education, foster care, or other defined circumstances; their funding comes from state and federal mental health allocations; and schools must understand that these agencies can serve only students with documented needs, treatment authorization, and case review requirements. Local Hospitals are large nonprofit or private institutions focused on emergency and inpatient care and are expected to provide “community benefits” that address public health needs; they offer emergency services, inpatient care, cancer care, surgery, labor and delivery, outpatient specialty services, and sometimes primary care; they serve all individuals in the region who need medical services; they are funded by Medicare, commercial insurance, and Medi-Cal reimbursement; and schools should know that hospitals generally do not prioritize prevention or early intervention, may have high indirect costs, are often affiliated with teaching programs, and nonprofit hospitals carry legal obligations to invest in community-benefit programs.There are other organizations that may become involved in delivering school health services such as private dentists, physician groups, local health plans or medical societies, but these are far less common.

Although every community is unique, there are some general organizational types that are most common and relevant for school health. The health care providers that deliver most health care for lower-income Californians with Medi-Cal or limited/no health insurance are collectively referred to as the health care “safety net.” These organizations often specialize in providing care for populations that face practical, cultural, and/or language barriers to accessing affordable, high-quality health care services. Health care staff often reflect the population served minimizing cultural and language barriers. Safety net providers are generally not-for-profit or public entities that often have access to specific health-related grants and funding streams that can support school-based, school-linked and other “place-based” services for specific populations. The table below depicts some of the most common health care provider types in California with core features that may be helpful for schools to understand, with a focus on the health care safety net. This table describes three types of health organizations by explaining what they are, what they exist to do, what services they typically provide, who they primarily serve, how they are funded, and what schools should consider when working with them. Community Health Centers are private or public nonprofit clinics governed by community boards that provide primary care, behavioral health for mild-to-moderate needs, dental care, lab and pharmacy services, enabling services like transportation and outreach, and health education to low-income and uninsured people; they are funded mostly by Medi-Cal and Medi-Cal managed care reimbursement with some federal and state grants, and they align well with school-based health centers but require high clinical volume and careful coordination, especially for students with commercial insurance. Local Health Departments are government-run agencies in all California counties and select cities that handle disease prevention, outbreak response, and public health emergencies; their services vary widely and may include vaccinations, HIV/STI services, home visits, and in some cases primary care, and they serve the entire local population with a focus on health disparities; they are funded mainly through population-based state allocations and various grants, and they align well with schools because of their population-health orientation though they can be slower due to government processes. Community Mental Health Agencies are mostly private community providers offering mental health and substance use services such as therapy, psychiatry, crisis", "private community providers offering mental health and substance use services such as therapy, psychiatry, crisis intervention, case management, and wraparound support to low-income individuals with moderate-to-severe mental health needs; they are funded through contracts with local Mental Health Plans for Medi-Cal services and already partner with many school districts to deliver services on campuses.

And because partnerships inherently introduce complexity, below are some tips and recommendations to ensure these partnerships are effective for the students and staff involved. Data and Information Sharing Schools should be aware that the laws governing confidentiality and release of health information may be different for their health care partners than they are for the school district itself. In general, a school health program’s records are subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) if the program is funded, administered and operated by or on behalf of a school or educational institution. However, health care provider records are subject to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) if the program is funded, administered and operated by or on behalf of a public or private health, social services, or other non-educational agency or individual. These federal laws regulate privacy and the exchange of specific types of information, and either HIPAA or FERPA may apply to control the release of the health records created when health services are provided on a school campus. Schools should know a few things, including: Although in a school setting, the parent/guardian typically has the ultimate authorization for education and school health services, there are some specific health care services that in California minors can consent to receiving without parent involvement. This includes services related to sexual health (pregnancy prevention, STI/HIV prevention and treatment), as well as some mental health and drug/alcohol related services. For services covered under the ‘minor’s consent’ health care providers are not permitted to involve families without the minor’s explicit permission and/or another legal reason. More information can be found here: www.schoolhealthcenters.org/consent In general, health care providers can not share protected health information with school personnel, even when services are provided on their campus, without signed authorization from the patient/client or their parent/guardian. (The same person who consents for the service is generally the person who needs to consent to releasing information about the care.) There are some exceptions to this rule, however, and case conferencing to support coordination of health care is allowable without an explicit release of information. SCHOOL HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS IN PRACTICE: A COMMON SCENARIO A health provider operating on a school campus provides a student with birth control pills. The student’s parent discovers these in the student’s backpack and learns they came from a school health center. Frustrated at having been left out of this decision, they approach the health center. The health center administrator politely explains state law and why they can not discuss these matters with the concerned parent. The parent then approaches a school administrator demanding information, recourse, and a change in policy. Despite everyone’s best intention, the health center staff can not share information with either the parent or the school unless the student authorizes it. This is in fact a very typical scenario that schools should plan and prepare for. They can help contextualize and explain the law and the reasons for the laws to parents and guardians to prevent misunderstandings and disruptions. Crisis Management with School Health Partners Health care providers on a school campus, as in any setting, are required to notify emergency personnel if a minor is expressing suicidal intent and has a viable plan that represents a danger to themself (Welfare and Institutions Code, Section 5150). Even if the provider engages emergency personnel on the school campus, they still can not divulge any details about this concern to the school administration. They can and should notify the school about the general activity, and will work with the student’s family as appropriate, but they must protect the privacy of the student or risk legal action. Schools need to understand and respect these laws, finding a way to coordinate effectively to support the student in crisis without unnecessarily disrupting normal school operations. Schools should assume that, like them, health care providers are acting in good faith, following the law, and protecting their clients and patients. School leaders should frame these issues for their staff to prevent hostility during tense moments and to establish clear expectations for all parties. It may be helpful to have a process in place for disagreements about what information can be shared and how to resolve these disagreements. Such circumstances are normal in this thorny territory, and all players should avoid making these issues personal, threatening the collaboration, or putting students and families in the middle/withholding helpful services. For much more detailed information on this complex and important subject, please see A California Guide for Sharing Student Health and Education Information | California School-Based Health Alliance and HIPAAorFERPAPrimerForCalifornia2Ed.pdf (schoolhealthcenters.org). Understanding Funding for School Health Services Another difference between LEAs and health care providers is in the funding they can access for providing similar services to similar populations. Generally, schools and LEAs can receive matching funding for specified health services such as speech therapy and medical transportation delivered to certain students through the LEA Medi-Cal Billing Option Program and Medi-Cal Administrative Activities programs, described in this related publication. These programs require that school districts demonstrate certain aspects of care delivery and compliance through a special claiming process. This process is not as cumbersome as the one followed by health care providers to receive reimbursement for health care services delivered through the traditional health insurance system. Here is a high level overview of how that system generally works: Most health insurance in California, including Medi-Cal, is provided through managed care organizations, also known as managed care plans or health plans. Managed care plans require that health providers such as doctors, clinics and hospitals establish contracts, and these contracts require that the individual clinicians employed go through a credentialing process in advance that can take several months. Before services are rendered, individuals need to be registered as patients or clients with appropriate informed Consent for Treatment, positive assent to a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices, and collecting demographic information/health history. For some services - e.g., dental cleaning, physical exam, immunizations, or care and prescriptions for asthma - informed consent must be provided by the parent or guardian of a non-emancipated minor. For others - such as sexual health services and some mental health treatment - the minor can consent to their own care. Before each visit, providers validate that patients are active members in the correct plan and county. For some services, prior authorization from the health plan is required. After the visit, providers submit detailed claims with information such as diagnosis, procedures, and other information. Claims are denied if any information is wrong, erroneous, or a service is not covered/approved. This “revenue cycle” can take 60 days or more to complete. Most of the information above is not collected by schools or typical school health personnel. And while schools generally offer health and other services that are “universal” - i.e., provided to all students regardless of health insurance or income, health care providers are often organized by types of insurance - e.g., the Kaiser delivery system is for those with Kaiser health insurance; and many providers and clinics are differentiated between patients that have Medi-Cal vs. private insurance coverage. For all these reasons, it is important for schools to understand that when they partner with community health care providers, and if the health care provider is relying on outside reimbursement to cover its costs, this may limit the number or types of students they can serve. It is also a good practice for all personnel to work toward the top of their skills, scope and license rather than doing tasks that someone with less training could perform. For all these reasons, a nurse practitioner employed by a community health center working in a school should not spend their days delivering basic first aid to students. It would likely not be able to collect this information to support ongoing service provision, whereas a school nurse could generate sufficient documentation to draw down LEA Medi-Cal matching funds. Each health care provider brings its own circumstances and often access to grants and funding. In California there are currently a number of initiatives aimed at helping provide more extensive health, behavioral health and social services to young people - e.g., the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative (CYBHI), Student Behavioral Health Incentive Program (SBHIP), CalAIM, and the California Community Schools Partnership. In general, it’s helpful to understand how your partners’ funding works and ways in which it can be leveraged to support more students and families in need. You can download the document “How Local Education Agencies and Partners Can Braid New Funding to Support School-Based Health Centers” here which further outlines the many funding sources that can be braided and blended to support school health services. Joint Fundraising To extend the benefits of school health partnerships, schools might consider working with their health care provider partners to explore ways to co-generate funding for the school health services. Often funders such as government and foundations value inter-agency and cross-sector collaborations. And having multiple agency types expands eligibility for funding streams that either alone might not qualify for. As partners grow more familiar with one another, they will naturally keep one another in mind when funding initiatives and opportunities emerge. It is strategic to engage entities such as the School Board, City Council and/or County Board of Supervisors as part of initiatives and investments in children and youth. Written Agreements Between Parties In school-health partnerships, misunderstandings and even conflicts can arise regarding a variety of issues ranging from space and information sharing to funding, communication, facilities maintenance, and other technical needs. To minimize friction and promote positive working relationships, CSHA and SCCOE strongly recommend that LEAs put in place written, formalized agreements between the school or school district and any health providers, even if no funding is exchanged. Agreements can take the form of contracts, Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), Letters of Agreement (LOAs), or any other appropriate legal document. These documents lay out relationships and responsibilities associated with the school health services. Some key elements of a written agreement include: Formal names of parties to the agreement Duration/term (can be determined by both parties involved; be sure to calendar times to review and update) Purpose/scope Each party’s responsibilities Fiscal agreements if any How outreach and marketing to students, families and school staff will occur Other expected communication (see below) Information sharing, privacy and confidentiality issues Any expected reporting between parties Liability and indemnification arrangements Recourse for failure to follow agreement How to amend, extend, renew or terminate the agreement Some examples of MOUs and other agreements can be found here: Sample Memorandum of Understanding (https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vision-to-Reality-Appendix-F1_-Memorandum-of-Understanding.docx) Sample Letter of Agreement (https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vision-to-Reality-Appendix-F2_-Letter-of-Agreement.docx) School Integration and Ongoing Communication School and district leaders can help promote positive school/health collaborations by facilitating clear expectations and level-setting early on, and ensuring shared understanding among all parties. For example, how will students be released from class to receive the health care services? How will teachers be notified about this excused absence? Although much of this early communications may be provided at an upper level of district administration, it is advised to consider assigning a clear liaison or point of contact for each health care provider partner closer to the point of service (e.g., a school vice-principal). And partners should also appoint a clear point of contact - depending on the service and the scope, this might need to be someone designated onsite (e.g., an SBHC administrator), or for a more intermittent/part-time service it can be someone working at the home agency who confirms schedules, communicates with families, and is available for trouble-shooting. Ideally the school can help promote the health services to students and families, and help streamline service enrollment by making information and forms available in various settings including front office, back-to-school events and websites. Ideally there should be periodic meetings or other communication with this liaison and the health partner even during times of stability. This will help ensure enough familiarity and trust is established to help during crisis, change and other challenges. As implied throughout this document, ongoing communication can help bridge the gap and support translation between the education and health care cultures that is normal and to be expected. The frequency and specifics of this communication depends on the partnership and services involved, and also how new the partnership is. More communication is typically needed on the early/front end of establishing services or a new program. Any time there is new school leadership and/or health center management, it is essential to build the individual and organizational relationship and expectations. Unfortunately, once a program is well established, communication often fades away. This is a mistake. The authors recommend ongoing communication between school and health partners, even if brief, on some regular cadence. Some other suggestions to ensure ongoing coordination and communication include inviting and encouraging health partners to participate in school professional development activities; presenting at staff meetings; hosting open houses, fairs and other events; engaging partners with PTSAs; and inviting partners to participate in Coordination of Services (COST) or other multidisciplinary case conferences designed to support students. Assessing the Effectiveness of Partnerships It is recommended that school leaders periodically re-visit their health partnerships to ensure they are still serving the school community well. This can take a number of forms, including a simple internal review with any aggregate data on program utilization and qualitative input from key stakeholders (school staff, students, families and the provider community). As always, concerns and constructive feedback should be used to make program adjustments and improvements whenever possible. This kind of consideration could be practiced every 1-2 years, also allowing partners to re-evaluate changes in programs, policies, school demographics, each agency’s strategic priorities, and any funding changes. Unlike the ongoing communication described in the previous paragraph, these conversations should involve those at the district or county level as well as those involved at the individual school site(s).", "chunks": ["Assuming a school or district decides it wants to partner with outside agencies, it’s never too late to improve the quality of those partnerships - even existing ones.

SCHOOL HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS IN PRACTICE: A COMMON SCENARIO A health provider operating on a school campus provides a student with birth", "COMMON SCENARIO A health provider operating on a school campus provides a student with birth control pills. The student’s parent discovers these in the student’s backpack and learns they came from a school health center. Frustrated at having been left out of this decision, they approach the health center. The health center administrator politely explains state law and why they can not discuss these matters with the concerned parent. The parent then approaches a school administrator demanding information, recourse, and a change in policy. Despite everyone’s best intention, the health center staff can not share information with either the parent or the school unless the student authorizes it. This is in fact a very typical scenario that schools should plan and prepare for. They can help contextualize and explain the law and the reasons for the laws to parents and guardians to prevent misunderstandings and disruptions. Crisis Management with School Health Partners Health care providers on a school campus, as in any setting, are required to notify emergency personnel if a minor is expressing suicidal intent and has a viable plan that represents a danger to themself (Welfare and Institutions Code, Section 5150). Even if the provider engages emergency personnel on the school campus, they still can not divulge any details about this concern to the school administration. They can and should notify the school about the general activity, and will work with the student’s family as appropriate, but they must protect the privacy of the student or risk legal action. Schools need to understand and respect these laws, finding a way to coordinate effectively to support the student in crisis without unnecessarily disrupting normal school operations. Schools should assume that, like them, health care providers are acting in good faith, following the law, and protecting their clients and patients. School leaders should frame these issues for their staff to prevent hostility during tense moments and to establish clear expectations for all parties. It may be helpful to have a process in place for disagreements about what information can be shared and how to resolve these disagreements. Such circumstances are normal in this thorny territory, and all players should avoid making these issues personal, threatening the collaboration, or putting students and families in the middle/withholding helpful services.

Understanding Funding for School Health Services Another difference between LEAs and health care providers is in the funding they can access for providing similar services to similar populations. Generally, schools and LEAs can receive matching funding for specified health services such as speech therapy and medical transportation delivered to certain students through the LEA Medi-Cal Billing Option Program and Medi-Cal Administrative Activities programs, described in this related publication. These programs require that school districts demonstrate certain aspects of care delivery and compliance through a special claiming process. This process is not as cumbersome as the one followed by health care providers to receive reimbursement for health care services delivered through the traditional health insurance system. Here is a high level overview of how that system generally works: Most health insurance in California, including Medi-Cal, is provided through managed care organizations, also known as managed care plans or health plans. Managed care plans require that health providers such as doctors, clinics and hospitals establish contracts, and these contracts require that the individual clinicians employed go through a credentialing process in advance that can take several months. Before services are rendered, individuals need to be registered as patients or clients with appropriate informed Consent for Treatment, positive assent to a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices, and collecting demographic information/health history. For some services - e.g., dental cleaning, physical exam, immunizations, or care and prescriptions for asthma - informed consent must be provided by the parent or guardian of a non-emancipated minor. For others - such as sexual health services and some mental health treatment - the minor can consent to their own care. Before each visit, providers validate that patients are active members in the correct plan and county. For some services, prior authorization from the health plan is required. After the visit, providers submit detailed claims with information such as diagnosis, procedures, and other information. Claims are denied if any information is wrong, erroneous, or a service is not covered/approved. This “revenue cycle” can take 60 days or more to complete. Most of the information above is not collected by schools or typical school health personnel. And while schools generally offer health and other services that are “universal” - i.e., provided to all students regardless of health insurance", "other services that are “universal” - i.e., provided to all students regardless of health insurance or income, health care providers are often organized by types of insurance - e.g., the Kaiser delivery system is for those with Kaiser health insurance; and many providers and clinics are differentiated between patients that have Medi-Cal vs. private insurance coverage. For all these reasons, it is important for schools to understand that when they partner with community health care providers, and if the health care provider is relying on outside reimbursement to cover its costs, this may limit the number or types of students they can serve. It is also a good practice for all personnel to work toward the top of their skills, scope and license rather than doing tasks that someone with less training could perform. For all these reasons, a nurse practitioner employed by a community health center working in a school should not spend their days delivering basic first aid to students. It would likely not be able to collect this information to support ongoing service provision, whereas a school nurse could generate sufficient documentation to draw down LEA Medi-Cal matching funds. Each health care provider brings its own circumstances and often access to grants and funding. In California there are currently a number of initiatives aimed at helping provide more extensive health, behavioral health and social services to young people - e.g., the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative (CYBHI), Student Behavioral Health Incentive Program (SBHIP), CalAIM, and the California Community Schools Partnership. In general, it’s helpful to understand how your partners’ funding works and ways in which it can be leveraged to support more students and families in need. You can download the document “How Local Education Agencies and Partners Can Braid New Funding to Support School-Based Health Centers” here which further outlines the many funding sources that can be braided and blended to support school health services. Joint Fundraising To extend the benefits of school health partnerships, schools might consider working with their health care provider partners to explore ways to co-generate funding for the school health services. Often funders such as government and foundations value inter-agency and cross-sector collaborations. And having multiple agency types expands eligibility for funding streams that either alone might not qualify for. As partners grow more familiar with one another, they will naturally keep one another in mind when funding initiatives and", "with one another, they will naturally keep one another in mind when funding initiatives and opportunities emerge. It is strategic to engage entities such as the School Board, City Council and/or County Board of Supervisors as part of initiatives and investments in children and youth. Written Agreements Between Parties In school-health partnerships, misunderstandings and even conflicts can arise regarding a variety of issues ranging from space and information sharing to funding, communication, facilities maintenance, and other technical needs. To minimize friction and promote positive working relationships, CSHA and SCCOE strongly recommend that LEAs put in place written, formalized agreements between the school or school district and any health providers, even if no funding is exchanged. Agreements can take the form of contracts, Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), Letters of Agreement (LOAs), or any other appropriate legal document. These documents lay out relationships and responsibilities associated with the school health services. Some key elements of a written agreement include: Formal names of parties to the agreement Duration/term (can be determined by both parties involved; be sure to calendar times to review and update) Purpose/scope Each party’s responsibilities Fiscal agreements if any How outreach and marketing to students, families and school staff will occur Other expected communication (see below) Information sharing, privacy and confidentiality issues Any expected reporting between parties Liability and indemnification arrangements Recourse for failure to follow agreement How to amend, extend, renew or terminate the agreement Some examples of MOUs and other agreements can be found here: Sample Memorandum of Understanding (https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vision-to-Reality-Appendix-F1_-Memorandum-of-Understanding.docx) Sample Letter of Agreement (https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vision-to-Reality-Appendix-F2_-Letter-of-Agreement.docx) School Integration and Ongoing Communication School and district leaders can help promote positive school/health collaborations by facilitating clear expectations and level-setting early on, and ensuring shared understanding among all parties. For example, how will students be released from class to receive the health care services? How will teachers be notified about this excused absence? Although much of this early communications may be provided at an upper level of district administration, it is advised to consider assigning a clear liaison or point of contact for each health care provider partner closer to the point of service (e.g., a school vice-principal). And partners should also appoint a clear point of contact - depending on the service and the scope, this might need to be someone designated onsite (e.g., an SBHC administrator), or for a more intermittent/part-time service it can be someone working at the home", "administrator), or for a more intermittent/part-time service it can be someone working at the home agency who confirms schedules, communicates with families, and is available for trouble-shooting. Ideally the school can help promote the health services to students and families, and help streamline service enrollment by making information and forms available in various settings including front office, back-to-school events and websites. Ideally there should be periodic meetings or other communication with this liaison and the health partner even during times of stability. This will help ensure enough familiarity and trust is established to help during crisis, change and other challenges. As implied throughout this document, ongoing communication can help bridge the gap and support translation between the education and health care cultures that is normal and to be expected. The frequency and specifics of this communication depends on the partnership and services involved, and also how new the partnership is. More communication is typically needed on the early/front end of establishing services or a new program. Any time there is new school leadership and/or health center management, it is essential to build the individual and organizational relationship and expectations. Unfortunately, once a program is well established, communication often fades away. This is a mistake. The authors recommend ongoing communication between school and health partners, even if brief, on some regular cadence. Some other suggestions to ensure ongoing coordination and communication include inviting and encouraging health partners to participate in school professional development activities; presenting at staff meetings; hosting open houses, fairs and other events; engaging partners with PTSAs; and inviting partners to participate in Coordination of Services (COST) or other multidisciplinary case conferences designed to support students. Assessing the Effectiveness of Partnerships It is recommended that school leaders periodically re-visit their health partnerships to ensure they are still serving the school community well. This can take a number of forms, including a simple internal review with any aggregate data on program utilization and qualitative input from key stakeholders (school staff, students, families and the provider community). As always, concerns and constructive feedback should be used to make program adjustments and improvements whenever possible. This kind of consideration could be practiced every 1-2 years, also allowing partners to re-evaluate changes in programs, policies, school demographics, each agency’s strategic priorities, and any funding changes.

Into the third decade of research on ACEs, the science is clear that: • ACEs are common and frequently co-occur; • ACEs are associated in a dose-response fashion with many leading causes of poor health in children and adults; • safe, stable, and nurturing relationships and environments can buffer the harmful effect of ACEs; and • while ACEs affect all communities, some populations are disproportionately impacted based on race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, and educational attainment. Other stressors that are rooted in structural and systemic factors (e.g., poverty, racism and other forms of discrimination, and exposure to community violence) may increase the likelihood of experiencing ACEs, increase risk of toxic stress, and reduce the availability of buffering supports (Bhushan et al., 2020). Findings from the 2016 National Survey of Children’s Health estimate that 46% of U.S. children under 18 years have been exposed to at least one childhood adversity, and 30% have been exposed to two or more (C. Bethell et al., 2017). On average, half of the students in a classroom are expected to have experienced one or more potentially traumatic events (Perfect et al., 2016). When left unaddressed or without the buffering support of safe, stable, and nurturing relationships and environments, the toxic stress that results from childhood adversity can have immediate and lifelong adverse effects on social, emotional, and physical well-being (C. D. Bethell et al., 2017; Maynard et al., 2019; Shonkoff & Garner, 2012), including academic success (Perfect et al., 2016). Despite the high prevalence of ACEs and their effect on child health and wellbeing, young people often do not receive necessary health services, particularly among historically excluded and underserved youth (Koball et al., 2021; Larson et al., 2017; Soleimanpour et al., 2017). Schools have increasingly become an important point of contact for prevention, identification, and treatment of physical and mental health needs for children and adolescents because of their availability and accessibility to students. Some studies indicate that school mental health services provide more access to services for youth than any other setting (Farmer et al., 2003; Kataoka et al., 2007; Lyon et al., 2013). School staff are often the first to identify student mental health problems and connect youth to mental health services, especially those who are unable or unlikely to access services in primary care or specialty mental health care settings (Green et al., 2013). In addition, given that academic problems are often related to mental and physical health difficulties (McLeod et al., 2012), schools are a compelling setting for integrated care models that address physical, mental health, and academic support services for youth. SCIENCE SAYS School-based health centers (SBHCs) constitute an important mechanism to improve access to and utilization of physical and mental health services, especially for medically underserved populations of youth (Farmer et al., 2003; Juszczak et al., 2003; Kataoka et al., 2007; Larson et al., 2017; Soleimanpour et al., 2010). SBHCs are located on school grounds and often employ multidisciplinary health and mental health professionals (e.g., nurses, psychologists and social workers) who consult regularly with school- and community-based supports for students (Larson et al., 2017; Weist et al., 2012) to help identify students and assure that students get needed services. SBHCs are convenient, culturally responsive and youth friendly, and eliminate structural barriers to service use such as transportation, cost, language barriers, available hours, and lack of confidential services for adolescents (Allison et al., 2007; Amaral et al., 2011; Juszczak et al., 2003; Larson et al., 2017). Additionally, SBHCs tend to have a schedule that allows for more time with patients and easier access to patients for follow-up care. SBHCs have demonstrated the ability to increase school attendance, improve academic scores, decrease school dropout, and provide high-quality care, and adolescents have favorable attitudes towards their use (Larson et al., 2017). SCIENCE SAYS Through California’s ACEs Aware initiative, the Office of the California Surgeon General and the California Department of Health Care Services lay out a roadmap to address ACEs in California through systemic reforms designed to prevent and screen for ACEs and treat toxic stress. The ACEs Aware initiative offers MediCal providers training, screening tools, clinical protocols, and payment for screening children and adults for ACEs (www.acesaware.org). Of the 293 SBHCs in California, approximately 70% are eligible to bill for MediCal services (California School-Based Health Alliance, 2021), positioning SBHCs in a critical role for reaching California’s most structurally disadvantaged youth.

These providers shared three models for how they have integrated ACE screening into their clinical workflow. EMERGING PRACTICE Provider screening model Provider screening model. In this model, ACE screening is integrated into the standard clinical workflow like other pediatric screening tools. The screen is commonly administered by medical staff (e.g., medical assistants) and reviewed by the medical provider during the clinical visit. During the visit, the provider discusses the results of the screen and provides the patient with education about toxic stress and/or intervention and support services as appropriate.

Staff explain that screening is confidential and voluntary. Following the screen(s), students meet with a medical provider for a clinical assessment.

This screening model is beneficial for identifying and responding to the needs of the entire student population and familiarizing students with the SBHC. However, it requires significant person power, preparation, collaboration and coordination.

Many of the barriers shared were consistent with those that have been cited in the literature (Gillespie, 2019; Marsicek et al., 2019). BARRIER Available mental health and social services Lack of resources and capacity to respond to identified needs. The most common barrier to ACE screening mentioned by SBHC providers across all three implementation models was the lack of resources and capacity to adequately respond to the identified mental health and social service needs. For most sites, their decision to start implementing ACE screening was contingent upon having sufficient resources, often the result of years of planning and additional grant funding to secure a network of behavioral health providers, case managers, health educators, and community partners. In some cases, these supports still felt inadequate. “There’s only one of me and there’s many young people that we need to see. And so, it’s really hard to prioritize and to know who to prioritize, when we should be seeing all young people. And we should be seeing every single person that comes into the clinic and doing the screenings with them.” - Medical Social Worker BARRIER Resources tailored for adolescents Concerns about adolescent-friendly, confidential care. There is very little research or resources for providers implementing ACE screening with adolescent populations in the context of confidential care (Pardee et al., 2017; Soleimanpour et al., 2017). There are even fewer resources tailored for special populations of adolescents such as those who have been in the foster care system, those who have been incarcerated, homeless youth, sexually trafficked youth, and/or LGBTQ+ youth (Soleimanpour et al., 2017). Providers expressed concerns about ACE screening in the context of adolescent confidential care, including the need to center youth relationships, the need to protect patient privacy and confidentiality, and the need for adolescent friendly scripts and resources.2 SBHCs are typically youth-centered settings that are viewed by young people as a source of positive, trusting adult relationships (Stone et al., 2013). Some providers we interviewed were concerned about the problem-focused nature of ACE screening and the potential to pathologize structurally vulnerable populations. They 2 At the time of this writing, ACEs Aware released on their website pediatric scripts that include adolescent specific scripts, which are available at: https://www.acesaware.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ACEs-Aware-Sample-Scripts-for-PediatricClinical-Teams.pdf 12 • etr.org expressed the importance of a holistic assessment that balances ACEs with positive childhood experiences or other protective factors. “I worry that it will negatively impact the relationships they have with their patients who are already so vulnerable and already don’t have a lot of adults that they trust.... We’re working so hard to get adolescents into medical care. We don’t want them to come one time, get an ACE screen and then not come back.” - SBHC Behavioral Health Provider BARRIER Confidentiality concerns Providers also stated the need to ensure both privacy and confidentiality in the context of screening. This was particularly true for clinics implementing a more traditional provider screening model where medical staff often provided patients with the ACE screen to complete in the waiting room. In settings where caregivers accompanied youth for clinical visits, they noted cases where caregivers were seen looking over the adolescent’s shoulder and even changing answers. Providers also noted that adolescents may not know the confidentiality laws around mandated reporting, and if they are filling out a screening form prior to a clinical conversation, they may not be aware of mandated reporting requirements. Finally, providers had questions about evidence-based, adolescent oriented scripts for ACEs education and best practices for screening and brief interventions in the context of a clinical visit. “I think explaining it to a teen is additionally really challenging if you’re just talking to the teen and relating it to them on a level that they can understand. So I think one of the first barriers is just getting them to buy into this thing that you’re talking about and understanding it.” - Nurse Practitioner “We meet once a month with providers to just talk about whatever... Sometimes we do get on the topic of ACEs and we talk about how we respond and everyone seems to do it differently. I always try to address it with them to say, “Thanks for filling out this form, it has a lot of personal questions. You might wonder why we’re asking all these personal questions and this is the reason why,” and I’ll explain to them. My form of trying to explain the ACEs to a teenager, which by no means probably has been validated in terms of their ability to understand it. But I do think that would be really awesome to have some form of training in which we can... Maybe it’s even like teaching teens about ACEs and then learning from those teens how they understood it, and what information we need to communicate to them that helps them understand ACEs. At what point is it too much information for them? Do you go into all the cortisol and hormones and all of that, or is it more on just a basic level?” - Nurse Practitioner BARRIER Unintended consequences Concerns about reactions, perceptions, and unintended consequences for parents/caregivers. Providers shared several concerns about potential negative consequences of ACE screening on parents and caregivers. These concerns varied. In a more rural setting, one provider we spoke with described a more conservative culture in which parents/caregivers would react negatively to questions perceived to invade family privacy and stressed the need for parent buy-in prior to adopting practices that address sensitive health topics among children and adolescents in the SBHC setting. Although legally, minors 12 years of age and older have the right to sensitive health services, the co-location of the SBHC on the school campus subjects the clinic to greater community scrutiny. Another provider talked about the stigma of addressing mental health in some communities, and particularly structural vulnerable communities with historic distrust of medical institutions. They stressed the need for more culturally responsive protocols and resources to facilitate patient-centered care. Other SBHC providers expressed concerns about the impact of ACE screening on immigrant families 13 • etr.org and whether Child Protective Services (CPS) reports would result in deportation for undocumented parents/ caregivers. BARRIER Additional training for clinicians and staff Training for clinical providers and staff. Medical providers (e.g., nurse practitioners and pediatricians) implementing ACE screening in a more traditional provider screening model expressed a need for more training, professional development, and support at the provider and staff levels. Primary care providers reflected on the lack of their own mental health training as a barrier to effectively implementing ACE screening. Beyond educating about ACEs and making mental health referrals, several medical providers we interviewed worried that they did not have the skills to adequately respond to mental health needs. “I can triage and do some general education about mental health care, but beyond that, it’s really hard... Sometimes you’re like, “Oh, I’m just in over my head here, and I’m not a therapist. And what do I say to this?”... You worry about these kids. So just to have the skills to deal with them. So that’s hard.” - Nurse Practitioner Additionally, some medical providers expressed a need for more training and support for clinic staff (e.g., front desk staff and medical assistance) who are responsible for administering the ACE screen with patients. This need was two-fold. First, clinic staff may not have the skills to effectively educate on the purpose of the ACE screen, explain confidentiality, or confidently navigate patient questions. Second, front line staff often do not have a support system to debrief their own experiences with hearing about others’ trauma, putting them at risk for secondary traumatic stress. BARRIER Time and paperwork Issues of time and paperwork. Some of the more frequently cited barriers to screening heard from nearly all learning collaborative participants and interview respondents were the issues of time and paperwork, which is consistent with findings from ACEs Aware (ACEs Aware, 2021). This was particularly challenging for teen well-child visits where patients are asked to complete multiple, sometimes overlapping screens (e.g., Staying Healthy Assessment, HEADSS Assessment, screening for depression, anxiety, PTSD, substance use, consent, and other paperwork). Providers shared common experiences of patients completing paperwork during, or even after the clinical visit, and screens not being addressed with patients because the forms were not filled out in time. Providers also noted the challenge of time to respond to high ACE scores. This was particularly challenging with adolescent populations with whom providers stressed the importance of time needed to build supportive and trusting relationships and to respond to emotionally charged disclosures. Some providers opted to only bring up the ACE screen during the clinical visit if the score was positive. “In the ACEs Aware literature, it keeps emphasizing how ACE screening only takes five minutes and that really hasn’t been a lot of people’s experience, especially if they screen at four or more and patients are at risk for toxic stress. I think it’s really hard to have that kind of bundled up into a little four-minute speech... I don’t always do the best job of education. I’ve been trying to do a little bit better, but again, yesterday my schedule was just too crazy and I don’t want to open up a can of worms. I don’t want to elicit a strong emotional response if I can’t bring them down. So you just have to make a decision.” - SBHC Pediatrician “Because as I am a social worker, I see the need of being able to assess and be able to ask more questions, follow-up questions, to ensure safety, to ensure stability, to ensure the young person’s needs. And so, I can see it being a barrier if we are just focusing on completing or getting young folks to complete the screenings and not necessarily assessing what their needs are and making sure that they are safe at this very moment in time and also being able to give them the opportunity to process their trauma.” - Medical Social Worker", "chunks": ["Some of these barriers cut across the three models, and others were unique to a particular screening model. Many of the barriers shared were consistent with those that have been cited in the literature (Gillespie, 2019; Marsicek et al., 2019). BARRIER Available mental health and social services Lack of resources and capacity to respond to identified needs. The most common barrier to ACE screening mentioned by SBHC providers across all three implementation models was the lack of resources and capacity to adequately respond to the identified mental health and social service needs. For most sites, their decision to start implementing ACE screening was contingent upon having sufficient resources, often the result of years of planning and additional grant funding to secure a network of behavioral health providers, case managers, health educators, and community partners. In some cases, these supports still felt inadequate. “There’s only one of me and there’s many young people that we need to see. And so, it’s really hard to prioritize and to know who to prioritize, when we should be seeing all young people. And we should be seeing every single person that comes into the clinic and doing the screenings with them.” - Medical Social Worker BARRIER Resources tailored for adolescents Concerns about adolescent-friendly, confidential care. There is very little research or resources for providers implementing ACE screening with adolescent populations in the context of confidential care (Pardee et al., 2017; Soleimanpour et al., 2017). There are even fewer resources tailored for special populations of adolescents such as those who have been in the foster care system, those who have been incarcerated, homeless youth, sexually trafficked youth, and/or LGBTQ+ youth (Soleimanpour et al., 2017). Providers expressed concerns about ACE screening in the context of adolescent confidential care, including the need to center youth relationships, the need to protect patient privacy and confidentiality, and the need for adolescent friendly scripts and resources.2 SBHCs are typically youth-centered settings that are viewed by young people as a source of positive, trusting adult relationships (Stone et al., 2013). Some providers we interviewed were concerned about the problem-focused nature of ACE screening and the potential to pathologize structurally vulnerable populations. They 2 At the time of this writing, ACEs Aware released on their website pediatric scripts that include adolescent specific scripts, which are available at: https://www.acesaware.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ACEs-Aware-Sample-Scripts-for-PediatricClinical-Teams.pdf 12 • etr.org expressed the importance of a holistic assessment that balances ACEs with", "https://www.acesaware.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ACEs-Aware-Sample-Scripts-for-PediatricClinical-Teams.pdf 12 • etr.org expressed the importance of a holistic assessment that balances ACEs with positive childhood experiences or other protective factors. “I worry that it will negatively impact the relationships they have with their patients who are already so vulnerable and already don’t have a lot of adults that they trust.... We’re working so hard to get adolescents into medical care. We don’t want them to come one time, get an ACE screen and then not come back.” - SBHC Behavioral Health Provider BARRIER Confidentiality concerns Providers also stated the need to ensure both privacy and confidentiality in the context of screening. This was particularly true for clinics implementing a more traditional provider screening model where medical staff often provided patients with the ACE screen to complete in the waiting room. In settings where caregivers accompanied youth for clinical visits, they noted cases where caregivers were seen looking over the adolescent’s shoulder and even changing answers. Providers also noted that adolescents may not know the confidentiality laws around mandated reporting, and if they are filling out a screening form prior to a clinical conversation, they may not be aware of mandated reporting requirements. Finally, providers had questions about evidence-based, adolescent oriented scripts for ACEs education and best practices for screening and brief interventions in the context of a clinical visit. “I think explaining it to a teen is additionally really challenging if you’re just talking to the teen and relating it to them on a level that they can understand. So I think one of the first barriers is just getting them to buy into this thing that you’re talking about and understanding it.” - Nurse Practitioner “We meet once a month with providers to just talk about whatever... Sometimes we do get on the topic of ACEs and we talk about how we respond and everyone seems to do it differently. I always try to address it with them to say, “Thanks for filling out this form, it has a lot of personal questions. You might wonder why we’re asking all these personal questions and this is the reason why,” and I’ll explain to them. My form of trying to explain the ACEs to a teenager, which by no means probably has been validated in terms of their ability to understand it. But I do think that would be really awesome to have some form of training in", "I do think that would be really awesome to have some form of training in which we can...

FACILITATOR Key champions Key champions. SBHCs implementing ACE screening all had a champion within the clinic and leadership support to spearhead the effort. In some cases, the agency leadership were champions themselves, and in others, the leadership supported the SBHC champions with the flexibility and freedom to implement ACE screening as a new practice. One provider shared that the agency leadership was interested in using the SBHCs as a pilot for how to expand ACE screening at other sites. Although not explicitly stated by the providers and key stakeholders we spoke with, the $29 payment for conducting ACE screenings for child and adult patients with full-scope Medi-Cal was also an implied facilitator of screening implementation. FACILITATOR Stakeholder engagement Stakeholder education, input, and feedback. Several clinics gathered input from key stakeholders prior to implementing screening and continued to collect feedback on screening implementation from youth and families. One SBHC engaged a Youth Advisory Board prior to implementing ACE screening to learn more from their adolescent population about how to implement ACE screening in a youth-centered manner. They learned that youth really wanted to know who would see their personal information, where it would be stored, and how it would be used. Youth gave advice on how they wanted the screen presented to them and role-played scenarios with clinical providers. This preparation was instrumental for supporting providers when starting to implement ACE screening. Another SBHC included an introduction letter, community resource list, understanding ACEs handout, and feedback form with the administration of the PEARLS. They reported a 95% percent completion rate and positive feedback by both parents and teens. FACILITATOR Trust SBHCs are a trusted source of care. Many providers mentioned that the positive, trusting relationships the SBHC had established with patients contributed to patient openness with ACE screening and disclosures of personal adversities and trauma. Providers described relational trust based on proximity to the community, frequent contacts (with youth in particular), and the investment of time during clinical visits to intentionally build relational trust. In SBHCs with integrated behavioral health and/or medical social workers/community health workers, providers also expressed the importance of being able to follow-up with young people at school to ensure youth were connected to care and to meet the needs identified through screening. “I think there’s a level of trust. A lot of families tell me things that, as far as their trauma, that they might not have told anyone about. So I think trust is a success. If they’re scoring positive and they’re giving me information, they trust that this is something that we might be able to help them with.” - SBHC Pediatrician “I think what has made our clinic work so well is the relationships that young people build with their medical providers and the trust. And one of the things for where we are, for some of our young people, they just don’t have that consistent adult presence or enough protective adult relationships... It’s a heightened level of importance, that attachment.” - SBHC Behavioral Health Provider FACILITATOR Integrated care Integrated behavioral health care and collaboration with mental health providers. All but one of the SBHCs represented in our professional learning collaborative and network of care interviews had on-site integrated behavioral health care. For medical providers implementing ACE screening, the ability to make a warm hand-off to a behavioral health provider allayed their concerns about not having the time or capacity to respond to more sensitive mental health needs that surfaced from a positive ACE screen during their clinical visit. A multidisciplinary team facilitates the holistic needs of the patient. While medical providers can help the patient regulate stress hormones and treat neurologic, endocrine and immune dysfunction that may result from toxic stress, mental health providers support and address unmet mental health and social needs. Positive patient response. Despite having concerns that ACE screening would negatively impact patient relationships, the providers that we spoke with unanimously shared positive stories of patients responding favorably to ACE screening, including both caregivers and youth, supporting other studies that demonstrate 15 • etr.org acceptability of ACE screening among caregivers of school-age youth (Koita et al., 2018; Marie-Mitchell et al., 2019). Providers shared that ACE screening and universal education on ACEs and toxic stress has helped to normalize the discussion of mental health, increase patient awareness of the connection between what has happened to them and their health, increase awareness of parenting practices, and provide a safe space for patients to talk about their adverse experiences and get support. In some cases, the conversation with patients that resulted from screening helped to deepen relational trust. FACILITATOR Patient receptiveness “One of the successes I think is that we’re normalizing this discussion in the primary care setting, which I think is great and I feel very honored that these families often share with me some very private things in their lives that they probably wouldn’t share with a lot of people in their lives.” - SBHC Pediatrician “I think there is a range of meeting with young people anywhere from three hours to maybe 30 minutes. And then discussing their trauma with them and what their needs are and what they can do and giving them coping skills around that. I also think, because I’m able to create these dialogues and these conversations with young people, that’s revolving around them and their trauma and things that they’ve experienced, has created really meaningful relationships within the clinic itself. And just having young people keep coming back. - SBHC Medical Social Worker “It’s brought to light a lot of things and a lot of kids have felt like they had a voice to at least express themselves in a safe place and get linked to services, if necessary, they needed to.” - SBHC Nurse Practitioner", "chunks": ["Despite these barriers, SBHC providers also shared factors that facilitated ACE screening implementation within their SBHC.

These models combine medical and behavioral health services to more fully address the spectrum of patient needs in the most acceptable and effective way to yield the best results for the patient (Gilgoff et al., 2020). Several models of integrated care have been studied among pediatric youth populations and found to enhance treatment of behavioral health symptoms in youth (Asarnow et al., 2015). The SBHCs that participated in our grant activities all utilized one of three different configurations for integrated care: coordinated (primary care providers communicate with community-based behavioral health providers via phone/web; referrals between organizations), co-located (primary care and behavioral health providers are co-located in the same setting or nearby) and collaborative (multidisciplinary teams work together; managing care coordinator) (Elkin et al., 2017; Lyon et al., 2016). CURRENT PRACTICE Coordinated care model Coordinated SBHC models. One rural SBHC that participated in our grant activities utilized a coordinated care model. The SBHC as well as all other schools, probation, and hospital services in the county use a single referral form for county mental health services and other social services. The county mental health services employ 1-2 therapists and two case managers for all youth in the county funded by Medi-Cal and Mental Health Services Administrations (MHSA). Therapists travel to schools and homes to offer groups and individual counseling, and they occasionally consult with educators to support individual students. County case managers provide transportation to services, provide psychoeducation, and connect youth and families with other social resources. Key stakeholders within this network of care lauded the strength of the coordination but were challenged by the limited resources and services available to meet the identified needs. “We do coordinate a lot. That’s one nice thing about a small community. As long as I get parental consent, and I can talk to the school, they can talk to me and we can coordinate like, ‘This kid’s really having a hard time. Let’s keep an eye on them.’ So we do a lot of coordination, which is really awesome because it’s a small community.” - SBHC Nurse Practitioner CURRENT PRACTICE Co-located care model Co-located SBHC models. Several SBHCs that participated in our grant activities utilized co-located models of care offering both medical and behavioral health services on site. All described the ability and capacity to do warm hand-offs with a behavioral health professional as a critical component of care and particularly important for teens resistant to any kind of therapy. If a student needs external services (e.g., dental services, social services), then these referrals are managed by someone in a case management role such as a community health worker or an AmeriCorps intern. “Often, we do warm handoffs. A lot of those. Because again, that’s the hook, because I’ll see kids are kind of hesitant. And it’s like, “Well, how about if you just meet one of the counselors? You don’t have to commit to anything.” Or, if they are not there, it’s like, “Well, let’s just schedule you an appointment, and if you don’t like it, you don’t come back?” And usually they find the person that they are going to talk to is not scary. A lot of the kids love having someone who’s going to listen just to them.” - SBHC Nurse Practitioner CURRENT PRACTICE Collaborative care model Collaborative SBHC models. Several SBHCs that participated in our grant activities also described collaborative care models where medical and behavioral health teams consult on individual patient care or where SBHCs collaborate with the school’s coordination of services team (COST), a team of staff members who come together on a regular basis, often weekly, to discuss how the school is providing services to 17 • etr.org students in need of additional support. In collaboration with COST, SBHCs sometimes receive referrals to see students, or if a student seen by the SBHC has an academic need, then a clinic community services manager may refer the student to COST and provide updates to COST on anything that is HIPAA compliant. Some SBHC behavioral health staff also provide consultation and coaching to teachers on how to work with students in the classroom. “We’ve become more integrated with the schools with the services we provide as well as being more of a collaborative partner with the staff. We are really embedded in the school’s meetings and their coordination of care... And so, I’ve gotten referrals straight through or from the school.” – SBHC Medical Social Worker", "chunks": ["Integrated care models, defined as care provided by a team of health professionals working together to coordinate and deliver services are increasingly popular as a result of their ability to increase accessibility and effectiveness of care for youth (Asarnow et al., 2005; Kolko et al., 2010; Richardson et al., 2014). These models combine medical and behavioral health services to more fully address the spectrum of patient needs in the most acceptable and effective way to yield the best results for the patient (Gilgoff et al., 2020). Several models of integrated care have been studied among pediatric youth populations and found to enhance treatment of behavioral health symptoms in youth (Asarnow et al., 2015). The SBHCs that participated in our grant activities all utilized one of three different configurations for integrated care: coordinated (primary care providers communicate with community-based behavioral health providers via phone/web; referrals between organizations), co-located (primary care and behavioral health providers are co-located in the same setting or nearby) and collaborative (multidisciplinary teams work together; managing care coordinator) (Elkin et al., 2017; Lyon et al., 2016). CURRENT PRACTICE Coordinated care model Coordinated SBHC models. One rural SBHC that participated in our grant activities utilized a coordinated care model. The SBHC as well as all other schools, probation, and hospital services in the county use a single referral form for county mental health services and other social services. The county mental health services employ 1-2 therapists and two case managers for all youth in the county funded by Medi-Cal and Mental Health Services Administrations (MHSA). Therapists travel to schools and homes to offer groups and individual counseling, and they occasionally consult with educators to support individual students. County case managers provide transportation to services, provide psychoeducation, and connect youth and families with other social resources. Key stakeholders within this network of care lauded the strength of the coordination but were challenged by the limited resources and services available to meet the identified needs. “We do coordinate a lot. That’s one nice thing about a small community. As long as I get parental consent, and I can talk to the school, they can talk to me and we can coordinate like, ‘This kid’s really having a hard time. Let’s keep an eye on them.’ So we do a lot of coordination, which is really awesome because it’s a small community.” - SBHC Nurse Practitioner CURRENT PRACTICE Co-located care model Co-located", "because it’s a small community.” - SBHC Nurse Practitioner CURRENT PRACTICE Co-located care model Co-located SBHC models. Several SBHCs that participated in our grant activities utilized co-located models of care offering both medical and behavioral health services on site. All described the ability and capacity to do warm hand-offs with a behavioral health professional as a critical component of care and particularly important for teens resistant to any kind of therapy. If a student needs external services (e.g., dental services, social services), then these referrals are managed by someone in a case management role such as a community health worker or an AmeriCorps intern. “Often, we do warm handoffs. A lot of those. Because again, that’s the hook, because I’ll see kids are kind of hesitant. And it’s like, “Well, how about if you just meet one of the counselors? You don’t have to commit to anything.” Or, if they are not there, it’s like, “Well, let’s just schedule you an appointment, and if you don’t like it, you don’t come back?” And usually they find the person that they are going to talk to is not scary. A lot of the kids love having someone who’s going to listen just to them.” - SBHC Nurse Practitioner CURRENT PRACTICE Collaborative care model Collaborative SBHC models. Several SBHCs that participated in our grant activities also described collaborative care models where medical and behavioral health teams consult on individual patient care or where SBHCs collaborate with the school’s coordination of services team (COST), a team of staff members who come together on a regular basis, often weekly, to discuss how the school is providing services to 17 • etr.org students in need of additional support. In collaboration with COST, SBHCs sometimes receive referrals to see students, or if a student seen by the SBHC has an academic need, then a clinic community services manager may refer the student to COST and provide updates to COST on anything that is HIPAA compliant. Some SBHC behavioral health staff also provide consultation and coaching to teachers on how to work with students in the classroom. “We’ve become more integrated with the schools with the services we provide as well as being more of a collaborative partner with the staff.

Similarly, schools also use a Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) framework for organizing school-based approaches to emotional, behavioral and academic needs of the entire student population (Bruns et al., 2016; Fazel et al., 2014). Like the ACEs Aware clinical response framework, MTSS is organized across three tiers. Universal interventions are delivered to all students at Tier 1. Students who are identified as needing additional help receive targeted support at Tier 2. Those who continue to need support are provided with intensive, individualized, Tier 3 interventions (Bruns et al., 2016). 3 As part of their tiered clinical response, SBHCs are in a unique position to collaborate with schools to address various levels of students’ need for prevention and intervention. The examples below highlight the various ways that SBHC providers we spoke with coordinated care with schools across these tiers of support. Figure 1.

In schools, Tier 1 services include universal prevention and education for students, caregivers, and school staff. Clinical providers (both medical and mental health providers) are often invited to go into classrooms to provide outreach and information about available SBHC services and education on various health topics. Clinic staff have also led education and prevention groups for students in partnership with the school, including lessons on mindfulness, sleep, and nutrition. Students conduct projects for class related to these health topics. In one district, the clinic is made aware of the health topics covered on the academic calendar, and they coordinate their health education offerings so that students are learning about a similar topic in school and through the clinic. 3 See the ACEs Aware Overview: A Tiered Clinical Response Framework for Addressing Toxic Stress available at: https://www. acesaware.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/An-Overview-A-Tiered-Clinical-Response-Framework-for-Addressing-ToxicStress.pdf 18 • etr.org SBHC staff also provide professional development opportunities with school staff around ACEs and their impact on students and families. They have helped to establish calming corners in school classrooms. One clinic has also offered luncheons with school staff to provide ACEs education. SBHC mental health professionals will attend weekly teacher’s meetings to share some trends they are seeing with students and get information about what is happening in the school context. “During COVID, SBHC providers went into the classrooms... to talk to them about how to get services and talk to them a little bit about the impact of, I guess, I did that trauma informed stuff about, like, ‘This is really weird. I imagine for you guys at your age, this is a lot more stressful and strange and isolating.’” - SBHC Nurse Practitioner “I know that there was some education done for the school by the LCSWs talking about calming corners that they integrated into the schools as well as doing their own mini professional development on trauma-informed care to keep them up to date. What we started trying to do is [follow the district’s] calendar of health topics, usually every month or quarterly, so we try to mimic that so that kids are learning about something in school, they’re also learning about it in the health center... in the last two years, we’ve been able to do peer education groups. We have AmeriCorps interns as well as myself or a behavioral health clinician supporting the groups. This year, it’s with sixth graders and the peer education ... They learn about sleep hygiene, mental health, mindfulness, nutrition and, at the end, they end up doing a project education session to teach back to us. That’s been really successful”. - SBHC Nurse Practitioner CURRENT PRACTICE Targeted interventions Tier 2 – Targeted Interventions. Tier 2 interventions are for individual students or groups of students identified as needing extra support beyond the universal prevention and strategies. Health educators, case managers, and/or clinical staff (both physical health and mental health staff) may follow-up with individual students or facilitate student groups on topics such as yoga and mindfulness, mental health, anxiety and other mental health issues, LGBTQ groups, and others. These groups can be coordinated in response to collective student needs for the prevention and treatment of toxic stress. “So all of the school counselors have my phone number and they’ll reach out like, “Hey, can you call me?” And I call and they’re like, “so and so is having a bad day today, do you have any extra time?” And if I do, I go over. If I don’t, then I typically make an appointment to go the very next day or follow up with them after school.” - Behavioral Health Provider CURRENT PRACTICE Intensive interventions Tier 3 – Intensive Interventions. In coordination with schools, Tier 3 interventions that extend beyond medical treatment typically involve co-located behavioral health services or referrals to external behavioral health providers. Some clinics do therapy sessions with students at the school, at their home, or through telehealth. One of the SBHCs we spoke with also sees patients that are not affiliated with the school – often for confidential family planning services through the Family PACT program. They have a taxi voucher system where they can transport students from other schools to the clinic to receive mental health counseling or birth control services. “I can only offer short term therapy. So roughly anywhere from 10 to less sessions, one to 10 sessions. And so, there’s young people who will come in and have very complex trauma and need, I feel clinically, they need long term services. And so, just having to connect with all these other agencies and seeing what is open, connecting to the access line, connecting with our behavioral health team to see if we have the capacity to take them on. So there’s a lot of coordination of care that comes with that one screening afterwards.” - SBHC Medical Social Worker", "chunks": ["ACEs Aware promotes a tiered clinical response framework for addressing toxic stress in individual patients that includes primary prevention (efforts to prevent harmful exposures that could lead to toxic stress), secondary prevention (efforts to reduce accumulation of risk factors for toxic stress), and tertiary prevention (efforts to lessen the severity, progression, or complications from toxic stress and ACE-associated conditions).

However, many barriers still exist, including geographical disparities in service accessibility, and mental health care workforce shortages (Mongelli et al., 2020). Current financing models are also seen as a potential barrier, because they often do not support restructured roles, partnership development, and the work to sustain upstream efforts to address toxic stress and community resilience (Ellis & Dietz, 2017). Through our professional learning collaborative and network of care interviews, SBHC providers and key stakeholders also identified the following barriers to treatment and coordination of care. BARRIER Capacity for mental health services Lack of resources and capacity to address mental health needs. As stated previously, SBHC staff and stakeholders identified not having the resources/capacity to adequately address mental health needs of their youth. For some SBHCs this lack of capacity is due to lack of any mental health providers on site, whereas other sites noted not having enough mental health providers to meet the overall need identified through screening. Lack of funding for all students to receive needed services and lack of resources to support billing student insurance, if available, is also a barrier. One SBHC noted that for a while, they were able to offer any patient any needed services for free due to grant funding. However, since the funding ended, they now need to refer insured patients to their primary care provider for select services, which can be a barrier to them actually receiving confidential mental health care. “That’s been one of my challenges since starting the school-based health center. And not having mental health services there, and limited mental health services here in general is how much depression and anxiety I’m seeing at the school clinic and feeling like, “Where do I refer these people, and what do I do?” - SBHC Nurse Practitioner BARRIER Data sharing restrictions Lack of coordination and data sharing across care providers and schools. The federal laws that govern data sharing and confidentiality are different for health providers and school-based health providers, and educators. The federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) governs education data while the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) governs health data. A SBHC’s service records are subject to FERPA if the program is funded, administered, and operated by or on behalf of a school or education institution but can be subject to HIPAA if it is funded, administered and operated by or on behalf of a public or private health, social services, or another non-educational agency. Lack of understanding of how these laws limit and/or facilitate sharing of information on student needs and progress monitoring is one barrier to coordination of care in SBHC settings. Some examples of how lack of data sharing impact care coordination include: coordination of care including communication about whether students connect to care providers after a referral; lack of information to referrers (e.g., teachers, principals) on student progress can create tension or lack of trust between SBHC providers and school staff; and difficulty coordinating care in student assistance meetings where data between agencies and schools cannot be disclosed freely. One of the SBHCs discussed how they are working on developing a multi-disciplinary team meeting hosted by the school to coordinate care, but they need legal help to figure out how to coordinate care across medical and educational services. “And we do weekly MDT meetings (multi-disciplinary team meetings) with CPS, and probation. We have a wraparound program too. So that happens every single week and then monthly my supervisor meets with, at least he’s scheduled to meet, with the school counselors and kind of have an MDT meeting with them. We have very strict rules around our MDT meetings... Everyone signs a contract about what data they can/cannot share for MDT meetings. If we were at a meeting and we hadn’t had all that stuff set in place, we couldn’t give any more than one identifier.” - SBHC Nurse Practitioner TREATMENT AND CARE COORDINATION: FACILITATORS FACILITATOR Integrated care Integrated behavioral health care and collaboration with mental health providers. All the SBHC providers we spoke with had some kind of integrated behavioral health care within their clinic ranging from coordinated, co-located, and collaborative models. These integrated care models help to ensure that students’ needs are adequately identified and addressed. In addition, some SBHCs we spoke with also received grant funding for positions dedicated to care coordination (e.g., wellness navigators, community health workers, medical social workers) to help bridge the gaps between referrals to behavioral health resources and to promote communication between schools, SBHC providers, and external community providers. “So I think the warm handoff was definitely a success. I think that was a really awesome piece, integrated mental health services within the clinic. I think without that, it would be really hard to have implementation of ACE screening.” - SBHC Nurse Practitioner “Yeah. I mean, I think that is the benefit of having in-house, right? You have a relationship with the mental health provider. You can collaborate. I think that’s a really awesome thing to have, so that was definitely positive. And we would with the warm handoffs, they would usually come and be like, “This patient doesn’t really seem ready, or this is actually where they need support. This is what I’m going to do and I would get that follow up.” – SBHC Nurse Practitioner FACILITATOR Good working relationships Positive relationships between SBHC staff and school staff. Across the board we heard that good working relationships between SBHC staff and school staff is essential for connecting students to services, treatment planning, and care coordination. We learned that while lack of buy-in related to school health services can be a barrier, staff support and buy-in related to school health services is a facilitator to treatment and care coordination. SBHC staff who are persistent in working with school staff in aligning health services with educational priorities were more successful in their efforts to integrate and coordinate care in schools. “The school loves us. They’ll bring kids over for counseling... We have different therapists in different levels. They’ll go over ACEs with them. The teachers even have our mental health people come into their classes and talk about this stuff, which is fabulous. The teachers, because of all this now, have tours.

Continue to fund and sustain an infrastructure to provide ongoing training and capacity building for trauma-informed systems and networks of care. Implementing trauma-informed systems of care requires ongoing training and support across sectors (e.g., education, health services, social services, behavioral health, caregivers and families) from leadership to frontline staff to establish a common language and personalized understanding about the science of ACEs and thriving as well as strategies for prevention and healing (C. D. Bethell et al., 2017). The ACEs Aware initiative currently offers trainings, webinars, learning collaboratives and toolkits to support capacity building around trauma-informed care, ACE screening, and treatment of toxic stress. Links to these and additional training resources are available in Appendix B. The key stakeholders we engaged in our grant activities elevated the following additional training and capacity building needs to address barriers to ACE screening and treatment of toxic stress in SBHCs: RECOMMENDATION Fund and sustain capacity building infrastructure • in-person training opportunities for front desk staff and medical assistants who may be less familiar with the science of ACEs and trauma-informed care in order to effectively implement relationship-centered screening, explain patient confidentiality, the purpose for ACE screening, how the screening data will be used and stored, and that screening is voluntary; • training for medical providers to increase their comfort and confidence to address and respond to sensitive issues and mental health needs that surface when implementing ACE screening during clinical visits, particularly for medical providers in under resourced or rural settings without strong networks of care or behavioral health support; • training for medical providers working specifically with adolescent populations to provide universal ACE education that is effective, youth-friendly, and responsive to adolescent developmental needs and concerns (including adolescent-friendly scripts and resources - also see Appendix B for some adolescent-friendly tools and resources that surfaced during our grant activities); • support for clinical providers and non-clinical staff implementing ACE screening to process patient experiences and vicarious trauma reactions that surface in the process of screening for ACEs; and • ongoing opportunities for professional learning communities to share in real-time current practices, challenging cases, and lessons learned to build the evidence-based and identify best practices for ACE education, screening implementation, and care coordination. In addition to the above topics, some providers we spoke with also raised tensions around potential unintended consequences of ACE screening that require opportunities for deeper reflection and dialogue to increase provider confidence with screening implementation. For example, some providers that we spoke with in our listening sessions, professional learning collaborative, and network of care interviews expressed a concern about the increase in identification of CPS cases that may result from ACE screening or the risk of deportation for undocumented caregivers. While CPS is intended to support children in families, some providers expressed distrust of the handling of CPS cases in their community and/or concern about racial bias that may disproportionately affect people of color. Training and capacity building opportunities that address these concerns across networks of care and that are substantiated with outcome-oriented data are needed. At the time of this writing, ACEs Aware released guidance for California’s Mandated Reporting Requirements and ACE Screening which helps to address this issue. 2. Increase funding and sustainability of mental health providers in SBHCs to advance the goal of ACEs Aware to both prevent and address the impact of ACEs and toxic stress. The current ACEs Aware initiative aims to train clinical teams to screen children and adults for ACEs in primary care settings and to treat the impacts of toxic stress with trauma-informed care and evidence-based interventions. As trusted health care providers with frequent touchpoints with children and families through well-child visits, medical providers 22 • etr.org play a critical role in the education, prevention, and treatment of toxic stress – particularly for opening the door to a conversation about ACEs and health, reducing mental health stigma, and treating the physical manifestations of toxic stress. However, increased funding for school-based mental health providers is also necessary to achieve this goal. SBHCs are located in some of California’s most under-resourced schools with complex physical health, mental health, and social service needs. The school-based health providers we spoke with stated that the availability of integrated mental health services was one of the most important factors for initiating and sustaining ACE screening and treatment in the SBHC setting. Yet these resources often fell short of the actual need. Increasing the number of mental health providers affiliated with SBHCs ensures that students can access beneficial care and support they need. RECOMMENDATION Fund prevention and mental health care School-based mental health providers also find that a lot of their time is taken up by “non-billable” services such as building relationships with community partners and providing education and workshops for school staff and students in classrooms. School-based mental health providers are able to push into schools to provide universal education to an entire school community about ACEs and toxic stress, what students and staff can do to mitigate the impact of toxic stress, and available resources. Universal education ensures all students receive beneficial education prior to a clinical ACE screen and can help health professionals build trust with and support special populations that are more likely to have experienced ACEs (e.g., justice involved youth, youth in foster care, immigrant youth, etc.) without requiring disclosure about ACEs. Reimbursement for these services would greatly increase the sustainability of mental health providers in SBHCs.4 RECOMMENDATION Expand telehealth 3. Expand telehealth resources and training for rural settings. Providers in the professional learning collaborative talked about the benefits of telepsychiatry support for primary care providers such as the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Child Adolescent Psychiatry Portal (CAPP) program. It is recommended that providers across California have access to tele-consultation for children’s psychiatry in order to provide more mental health support to children and families particularly in rural communities where access to children’s psychiatry can be limited.

Beyond integrated care models, SBHCs have advantages in creating networks of care that prevent and address ACEs due to their location and collaboration with the education staff on their campus. We recommend that SBHCs become involved in collaborative service provider meetings that take place at schools and leverage these meetings to develop access and referral pathways that can meet student needs. Additionally, schools and community partners can creatively address the ACEs Aware stress busters for entire student populations.

Attendees included a wide range of school health professionals (e.g., school nurses, mental health providers, clinicians, administrators) who self-selected into the conference session. Most of these participants were not currently implementing ACE screening in a clinical setting. The listening sessions gathered insights from school health staff on their awareness of the ACEs Aware Initiative; current practices, barriers and facilitators around trauma-informed care, ACE and trauma screening, and care coordination; the impact of COVID-19 on schools and SBHCs; and questions and technical assistance needs related to the implementation of ACE screening and trauma-informed care. Listening sessions notes were coded by key themes. Virtual Professional Learning Collaborative: Through our Provider Engagement Peer-to-Peer grant, we hosted a virtual professional learning collaborative with nine school-based health providers (including two physicians, four nurse practitioners, one school counselor, one lead school nurse, one clinical therapist) and two public health researchers from our team. Participants were eligible to participate in the collaborative if they were currently implementing or planning to implement ACE screening in a SBHC setting and could commit to attending all six virtual sessions. Selected applicants represented a diversity of providers based on location (California region, urbanicity, school size), youth demographics (grade level, race/ethnicity, socio-economic status), and provider experience. Participants represented six counties across California serving rural and urban middle and high schools. Two participants represented SBHCs that had a sustained clinical practice of ACE screening; one participant recently started ACE screening in their SBHC, and the remaining participants were planning to implement ACE screening. The collaborative met monthly from November 2020 through April 2021. Sessions included a 50-minute presentation and discussion on a focal topic facilitated by our project team followed by a 30-minute case study presented by a learning collaborative participant. Recordings were transcribed and coded for key themes. In-Depth Interviews: Through our Provider Engagement Network of Care Grant, we identified and invited four SBHCs currently implementing ACE screening to participate in network of care interviews to learn more about the coordination of care at their site. We interviewed ten stakeholders across these four sites, including five SBHC medical providers, two SBHC-affiliated mental health providers, one SBHC medical assistant, one county mental health provider, and one wellness navigator. We were unable to contact school representatives at each site. Three interviewees also participated in the Professional Learning Collaborative. Two participating SBHCs were located at urban high schools, one was located at an urban middle school, and one was located at a rural high school. Recordings were transcribed and coded for key themes. Literature Review and Environmental Scan: We conducted a literature review and environmental scan to understand the landscape of trauma-informed approaches used in a school or pediatric clinical setting, as well as implementation of ACE screenings in these settings. We hoped to learn from the literature how trauma-informed care is implemented in SBHCs and among adolescent populations; barriers and facilitators to implementing trauma-informed care, ACE screening, or mental health services and interventions in a pediatric clinical setting or SBHC; and specific considerations for special populations (e.g., immigrant youth, youth in foster care, justice-involved youth, pregnant and parenting teens, etc.). Search Strategy: We conducted a keyword search on three databases: PubMed, PsycInfo and Web of Science. We conducted searches under the four categories of: broad trauma-informed approaches, buy-in or support to implementing ACE screening or sensitive practices in clinical settings, ACEs in school-based health centers, and screenings in school-based health centers (e.g., SBIRT - Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment, or RAAPS - Rapid Assessment for Adolescent Preventive Services). Some keywords included: pediatrics, clinical care, school-based health centers, school wellness centers, trauma-informed, stakeholder, community, leadership, champions, readiness, engagement, support, ACEs, adverse childhood experiences, trauma-informed care, toxic stress, screening, assessment, SBIRT, RAAPS). Google Scholar and school mental health web resources were also scanned for relevant papers. After duplicates were removed, a total of 215 papers were identified. Inclusion Criteria: Studies were included if they described trauma-informed care or mental health screening in school-based or pediatric clinical settings. All studies were published in English. Included studies were published between 1997-2021. Coding and synthesis: Once studies were identified, titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion and categorized by topic of interest (e.g., trauma-informed care, ACE screening). Within each category, included studies were analyzed to understand barriers, facilitators and recommendations for screening implementation.", "chunks": ["Listening Sessions: Through our Provider Engagement Peer-to-Peer grant, we hosted four virtual listening sessions with a total of 110 attendees of the California School-Based Health Alliance State Conference in October 2020. Attendees included a wide range of school health professionals (e.g., school nurses, mental health providers, clinicians, administrators) who self-selected into the conference session. Most of these participants were not currently implementing ACE screening in a clinical setting. The listening sessions gathered insights from school health staff on their awareness of the ACEs Aware Initiative; current practices, barriers and facilitators around trauma-informed care, ACE and trauma screening, and care coordination; the impact of COVID-19 on schools and SBHCs; and questions and technical assistance needs related to the implementation of ACE screening and trauma-informed care. Listening sessions notes were coded by key themes. Virtual Professional Learning Collaborative: Through our Provider Engagement Peer-to-Peer grant, we hosted a virtual professional learning collaborative with nine school-based health providers (including two physicians, four nurse practitioners, one school counselor, one lead school nurse, one clinical therapist) and two public health researchers from our team. Participants were eligible to participate in the collaborative if they were currently implementing or planning to implement ACE screening in a SBHC setting and could commit to attending all six virtual sessions. Selected applicants represented a diversity of providers based on location (California region, urbanicity, school size), youth demographics (grade level, race/ethnicity, socio-economic status), and provider experience. Participants represented six counties across California serving rural and urban middle and high schools. Two participants represented SBHCs that had a sustained clinical practice of ACE screening; one participant recently started ACE screening in their SBHC, and the remaining participants were planning to implement ACE screening. The collaborative met monthly from November 2020 through April 2021. Sessions included a 50-minute presentation and discussion on a focal topic facilitated by our project team followed by a 30-minute case study presented by a learning collaborative participant. Recordings were transcribed and coded for key themes. In-Depth Interviews: Through our Provider Engagement Network of Care Grant, we identified and invited four SBHCs currently implementing ACE screening to participate in network of care interviews to learn more about the coordination of care at their site. We interviewed ten stakeholders across these four sites, including five SBHC medical providers, two SBHC-affiliated mental health providers, one SBHC medical assistant, one county mental health provider, and one wellness navigator. We were unable to", "medical assistant, one county mental health provider, and one wellness navigator. We were unable to contact school representatives at each site. Three interviewees also participated in the Professional Learning Collaborative. Two participating SBHCs were located at urban high schools, one was located at an urban middle school, and one was located at a rural high school. Recordings were transcribed and coded for key themes. Literature Review and Environmental Scan: We conducted a literature review and environmental scan to understand the landscape of trauma-informed approaches used in a school or pediatric clinical setting, as well as implementation of ACE screenings in these settings. We hoped to learn from the literature how trauma-informed care is implemented in SBHCs and among adolescent populations; barriers and facilitators to implementing trauma-informed care, ACE screening, or mental health services and interventions in a pediatric clinical setting or SBHC; and specific considerations for special populations (e.g., immigrant youth, youth in foster care, justice-involved youth, pregnant and parenting teens, etc.).

Understand Trauma and Stress “Without understanding trauma, we are more likely to misinterpret trauma-related behaviors as willful, “sick,” or “crazy,” which can lead to ineffective, stigmatizing and/or punitive reactions to trauma-impacted people. This reframing can help us to recognize these effects more accurately, which can then lead to more compassionate and strength-based, effective responses to trauma-impacted people that can promote healing as opposed to reacting in a way that inadvertently re-traumatizes and causes harm.” (SFSU) 2. Cultural Humility and Equity When we understand that trauma is caused by structural oppression & work together to mitigate these harms, including through our own self-reflection and understanding of power imbalances in our schools; we enhance equity.3. Establish Safety and Predictability Trauma results when physical, emotional & relational safety is violated. Establishing physical, relational, and emotional safety, as well as predictability in our schools, can assist us in focusing resources on healing & improve students’ ability to attend to learning. 4. Foster Compassionate and Dependable Relationships Trauma is relational in nature so the healing is equally relational. When we foster relationships with students, families, and each other that are compassionate and attuned as well as predictable and dependable, we develop trusting relationships that increase our capacity for healing and learning together. 5. Promote Resilience and Social Emotional Learning Trauma can negatively impact the development of healthy skills in regulating emotions, cognitions, and behaviors, as well as healthy interpersonal skills, which can then compound trauma’s negative effects in the classroom. Promoting wellness practices and teaching social emotional learning competencies of self-management, self-awareness, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision making (CASEL, 2012) can build resilience and support students ability to attend to the tasks of learning. 6. Empowerment and Collaboration Trauma involves a loss of power and control that can cause a sense of helplessness & hopelessness. When students, families, and staff are given meaningful opportunities to participate in the school community, have their strengths acknowledged & built on, and are given voice & choice in what happens, we can develop a community where everyone feels empowered and connected.

Neuroscience tells us the brain feels safest and relaxed when we are connected to others we trust to treat us well (Hammond 2015). This means that building trusting relationships with students and families provides a foundation that is necessary in order to build a learning environment where it is safe to take risks, attend to educational tasks, and develop a sense of belonging to the learning community. Optional: Include a video to further demonstrate what relational teaching might look like in practice. Several options are included in background information below.Ask participants, “what strategies do you use to build rapport and trust with your students?”Included here are some strategies that can support in building meaningful, trusting relationships. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but provides some ideas for where to start in fostering safe, trusting relationships on school campuses. 1. Prioritize relationships as integral to learning environment Spend extra time getting to know students, identify shared interests & values, utilize community building circles in classroom2. Identify & affirm specific strengths3. Praise progress & problem-solvingReflect back to students the way they solved a problem or made progress toward a goal, focus especially on the process. For example, rather than “good job!” try “I noticed that after you took a break in the calm corner, you went back to that math problem and tried again. I really appreciate you putting in the effort to stay on track today.” 4. Model respectful, nonviolent relationshipsModel the social skills you wish to see in your students. This might look like demonstrating empathy with students & colleagues, asking permission before giving feedback or giving choice about when feedback happens (“can I show you a different way to solve that?” “I’d like to go over the quiz together, would you like to do that now or after class?”), remaining curious rather than judgemental. 5. Explicit teaching of coping skills6. Selective vulnerabilityShare challenges you had as a student their age. Model connecting your own experiences to feelings, behaviors and coping strategies (example: “I slept through my alarm this morning and rushed to get here. I’m feeling a little frustrated and embarrassed. While you’re completing the do-now, I’m going to spend a few minutes breathing and getting myself settled so that I can be present with you”) The information shared should be selective and appropriate.7. Acknowledge students’ experiences (identify & validate)Demonstrate concern and care by putting words to students’ experiences. (example: “You felt really disrespected when Sandra took the markers from your desk without asking. It makes sense that you would feel that way. We can figure out a way to solve this right now, or if you’d like you can take a break for a few minutes in the calm corner first.”)BACKGROUNDMurray, D., Rosanbalm, K., & Christopoulos, C. (2015).

Slide 12: Self-regulation, or the ability to independently manage one’s emotions and behaviors in accordance with the demands of the situation is often assumed by schools to be inherent in a child’s development. In reality, self-regulation is a skill that must be actively taught. One way that self-regulation can be taught is through the use of modeling. Parents are often modeling these skills in early childhood, but this can not be assumed for everybody, particularly when a family has been impacted by trauma. In schools, modeling self-regulation can be done in a setting where students are themselves regulated & attuned to learning; and can also be done when a student is in distress through the practice of co-regulation. Co-regulation is defined as warm and responsive interactions that provide the support, coaching, and modeling children need to “understand, express & modulate their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors” (Murray, et al 2015, 14) Practice1. Tell participants, “We are now going to have the opportunity now, to practice co regulation with one another. Before we begin, I invite you to take a few moments to move around in a way that feels good to you--perhaps you’d like to stand up, stretch, have a sip of water, or take a few deep breaths.” 2. Once participants have been given the opportunity to take a brief brain break, ask participants to find a partner in the room3. Ask each pair to choose person A and person B. Person A will share first, while person B provides coregulation support. After several minutes, participants will trade roles. 4. Inform person B that they will all be a supportive listener during this exercise. They can utilize co regulation strategies--taking deep breaths, providing nonverbal communication, offering gentle eye contact. They will not be providing verbal feedback, asking follow up questions, etc. 5. Ask person A to identify something stressful that happened at work recently that they would be willing to share with their partner. Ask them to bring to mind what happened, who was there, what they heard or saw, how they felt...6. Now ask person A to share about this experience with person B while person B holds a non-judgmental, coregulating space. 7. After 4 minutes, let participants know that they will soon be changing roles and should begin wrapping up their sharing if they have not already done so. 8. Ask participants to each take a few deep breaths and change roles, repeating steps 4-6. 9. Debrief with participants: 1. What was it like to be the person sharing? What did you notice about how it felt in your body to be sharing?2. What was it like to be the person listening? Were there times you wanted to interrupt or engage verbally? What was it like to focus on your own breathing and emotion regulation? 3. How do you imagine you could use this strategy when you are with a student who is dysregulated?

Neuroscience tells us the brain feels safest and relaxed when we are connected to others we trust to treat us well (Hammond 2015). This means that building trusting relationships with students and families provides a foundation that is necessary in order to build a learning environment where it is safe to take risks, attend to educational tasks, and develop a sense of belonging to the learning community. Optional: Include a video to further demonstrate what relational teaching might look like in practice. Several options are included in background information below.Ask participants, “what strategies do you use to build rapport and trust with your students?”Included here are some strategies that can support in building meaningful, trusting relationships. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but provides some ideas for where to start in fostering safe, trusting relationships on school campuses. 1. Prioritize relationships as integral to learning environment Spend extra time getting to know students, identify shared interests & values, utilize community building circles in classroom2. Identify & affirm specific strengths3. Praise progress & problem-solvingReflect back to students the way they solved a problem or made progress toward a goal, focus especially on the process. For example, rather than “good job!” try “I noticed that after you took a break in the calm corner, you went back to that math problem and tried again. I really appreciate you putting in the effort to stay on track today.” 4. Model respectful, nonviolent relationshipsModel the social skills you wish to see in your students. This might look like demonstrating empathy with students & colleagues, asking permission before giving feedback or giving choice about when feedback happens (“can I show you a different way to solve that?” “I’d like to go over the quiz together, would you like to do that now or after class?”), remaining curious rather than judgemental. 5. Explicit teaching of coping skills6. Selective vulnerabilityShare challenges you had as a student their age. Model connecting your own experiences to feelings, behaviors and coping strategies (example: “I slept through my alarm this morning and rushed to get here. I’m feeling a little frustrated and embarrassed. While you’re completing the do-now, I’m going to spend a few minutes breathing and getting myself settled so", "the do-now, I’m going to spend a few minutes breathing and getting myself settled so that I can be present with you”) The information shared should be selective and appropriate.7. Acknowledge students’ experiences (identify & validate)Demonstrate concern and care by putting words to students’ experiences. (example: “You felt really disrespected when Sandra took the markers from your desk without asking. It makes sense that you would feel that way. We can figure out a way to solve this right now, or if you’d like you can take a break for a few minutes in the calm corner first.”)BACKGROUNDMurray, D., Rosanbalm, K., & Christopoulos, C. (2015).

Next, ask participants to flip the index card over and write something they are nervous about. 4. Collect index cards5. Shuffle the cards and randomly redistribute one to each participant. Now every participant should have a completed card in front of them.6. Go around the circle once to share the answer to “something you are nervous about...” Next, go around the circle again to share “what are you looking forward to...”COMMUNITY AGREEMENTS - 10 MININSTRUCTIONSDeveloping Community Agreements1. Take time to define what a “community agreement” means. A helpful definition is as follows:“A consensus on what every person in our group needs from each other and commits to each other in order to feel safe, supported, open, productive and trusting...so that we can do our best work, achieve our common vision, and serve our students well.” (National Equity Project) Community agreements are not rules. They are about explicitly naming the ways in which we want to be in community with one another. They are developed and enforced collectively, rather than from one authority figure. 2. Explain why community agreements are important in this context1. We cannot have the discussions necessary to become leaders in healing-centered work in a group setting that is hostile or undermining to the principles of trauma-informed care. 2. Having vulnerable conversations where we bring our full selves to this work is critical in furthering our practice as trauma-informed educators. We need to foster a culture of safety, trust, and mutuality in order to make this available to everyone in the group. 3. Trauma work is relational. One of the most powerful ways we can encourage healthy relationships amongst students is to model it between ourselves. 3. Develop Community Agreements1. Ask participants to respond either on paper or to reflect quietly to themselves to the prompts: “What do you need from this group in order to feel safe, supported, open to new learning?” “What do you need from the group to feel that time spent here is meaningful and productive?”2. In groups of three, share responses. Each group should synthesize responses onto a shared list. 3. Ask for someone to volunteer as “scribe to write down each idea onto a poster paper.4. Each group share out their lists--leave room after each group share for discussion.5. After each group has shared and a collective list has been formed, ask participants to demonstrate agreement (or disagreement) for each. You may wish to use thumb signals (up/middle/down). For all agreements that have group consensus, put a star next to them. For any without consensus, put aside for now. 6. If there are any remaining agreements that did not gain consensus of group, facilitate further discussion to support the group in determining whether they can be changed or further explained in order for all members to be comfortable agreeing. 7. Facilitator simplify language and/or combine overlapping agreements and share out to group; stopping on each to check for consensus. 8.

Helpful information to share may include percentage of students screening positive for history of trauma and/or trauma related mental health issues, percentage of students falling below the poverty line, number of students served by the mental health team on campus, etc. This may also be a helpful place to share any school data related to disparities in education outcomes or discipline across race, gender, and disability.

Often with the pressure on schools to produce test scores & meet core standards, SEL literacy can be approached as an afterthought. However, attending to relational and emotional skills is an essential component in students’ ability to learn and grow in their academic skills.

Fight-Flight-Freeze-FawnBriefly review fight-flight-freeze-fawn for participants who may be newer to trauma work. When someone is confronted with a real or perceived threat to their own or someone else’s safety, the mind enters into an automatic “survival mode.” This is a really useful and important function of the brain. If we are hiking in the woods and we see a bear, our brain will automatically instruct of to do one of several things. It may instruct us to fight the bear-throw rocks, use bear spray, etc. It may instruct us to run away, also known as flight. It may instruct us to freeze, at which point we may “play dead” or stop moving all together. It may also instruct us to fawn over the bear--maybe we throw it some delicious berries or use a calm voice to say, “it’s ok bear, I mean you no harm.” All of these responses are appropriate and important to our ability to survive an encounter during which our safety is threatened. What we see in PTSD and in people who have experienced ongoing or complex trauma, is survival mode getting turned on without experiencing a safe way to turn it off. 4 Fs in SchoolsDivide participants into four groups.

Provide evidence by citing progress and growth in other areas.3. Validate the student’s ability to master the learning target while acknowledging high demands of the task.4. Analyze the task together, identifying the easy and hard parts.5. Deliver feedback that is specific, actionable, and timely. Restate what the final goal is and what mastery looks like and then show them where they are in relationship to the goal.6. Create space for them to react to what they heard and how they feel about it.7. Provide specific actions to take to improve, and ways to track their progress.8. Ask them to paraphrase what they heard you say- what is wrong, what needs to be fixed, and how to go about fixing it.9. Offer emotional encouragement and restate your belief in them.10. Set up a time to follow-up and check progress.PracticeWith a partner, choose one person to act as the educator/mentor and the other as the student/mentee.

Group DiscussionUse the following questions to guide full group discussion about building alliance through our style of relating. • Why do you need to use the trust generated in the rapport stage in the alliance stage? • How would you use it? • How do we validate students’ experience within the social-political context? ASSET-BASED FEEDBACK - 12 MINUTESMATERIALS• Learning Partnership HandoutINSTRUCTIONSProvide each participant with a copy of the Learning Partnership Handout. Instruct participants to identify 1-2 focal students from the list generated earlier in the workshop that they would like to prioritize over the next month.

Slide 5: Burnout.Ask participants, “who has heard the term burnout? What causes it? What options are there for addressing it?” Explain “we often hear the term “burnout” being used to describe educators’ experiences. While burnout is very common in education & healthcare fields, there is a tendency to conflate it with vicarious trauma which we will get into in a moment. Burnout can occur in any professional or educational setting and is characterized by a depleted ability to cope with work/life demands.”Slide 6: Compassion Fatigue & Vicarious Trauma.The remainder of this is workshop focused on vicarious trauma. The tendency to conflate this with burnout leaves folks experiencing vicarious trauma feeling isolated, misunderstood, and frustrated--particularly when they have employed all of the typical recommendations for managing burnout “take a break, go outside, run a bath” with little effect. While these may be useful strategies for self care, it is important for people working in trauma-impacted environments are provided information and support in managing vicarious trauma. Vicarious trauma & compassion fatigue are terms often used interchangeably to explain the inner-experience of the helper resulting from empathetic engagement with traumatized clients or communities.” Using the definitions included in the slide, discuss with participants that while related, they both describe slightly different experiences.Slide 7: Vicarious Resilience. Vicarious resilience happens when educators (or other helping professionals) experience personal growth in their own life through witnessing the growth of their students. Witnessing students or their families overcome adversity has a positive effect on the professionals supporting them. An educators’ own beliefs and feelings can change and allow them to reassess their own problems and are better able to cope with their own adversity. (Hernandez, Gangsei & Engstrom, 2007).BACKGROUNDFreudenberger, H. (1974). , Burnout: The high cost of high achievement.Hernández P, Gangsei D, Engstrom D.

PMID: 17593887.REFLECT & SHARE - 5 MINUTESJournal & Group shareMATERIALS• Paper• Writing Utensil INSTRUCTIONSReflectAsk participants to take a few moments to reflect on their work in a trauma-impacted environment. They may choose to reflect through writing, drawing, or thinking about answers to the following prompts: • How has your work in a trauma-impacted school has had a positive influence on the way you see the world, yourself, or what matters to you (your sense of meaning and purpose, hope and faith)?• How has your work in a trauma-impacted school has had a negative or challenging influence on the way you see the world, yourself, or what matters to you?ShareIn small groups of 3-4, or as a large group; give participants an opportunity to share something that came up for them during the exercise. Participants may choose to share an answer to one of the prompts, or share more broadly about what it was like to reflect in this way. This exercise may be one of the few times participants have explicitly been asked to reflect on the challenges of trauma work. It will be important for you to hold a non-judgmental & empathetic space for sharing. If you choose to have participants share in the large group, acknowledge participants’ willingness to share by validating, normalizing and thanking them for their responses. If participants will share in small groups, you will want to encourage listeners in each group to maintain curiosity & empathy for their colleague as well as avoid using this time for problem-solving/advice-giving, or one-upping (i.e. “if you think that’s bad, you won’t believe what happened to me...”)MY MENTAL HEALTH CONTINUUM - 10 MINUTESIndividual Care PlanMATERIALS• “My Mental Health Continuum” Worksheet• Writing utensilINSTRUCTIONSProvide participants with “My Mental Health Continuum” worksheet. Explain that mental health is something everyone has and that it is not a fixed experience. Mental health changes occur in response to the interdependent workings of our internal experiences, external stressors or pleasures, and the environments we are immersed in. For this exercise, we will be reflecting on the ways our own mental health shifts and create a plan that is responsive to those shifts. Review the three categories “thriving,” “surviving,” and “struggling/in-crisis.” Someone who is thriving is able to experience pleasure, successfully utilize a wide range of strategies to respond to life’s challenges, attend to the present while planning for the future, and meaningfully engage in relationships that are important to them. Someone who is surviving is focused on just making it through the day. They are at the limits of their capacity for self-care. They may often be worrying about the inevitable next crisis rather than remain present in the moment. They may find it challenging to engage in the activities they usually enjoy and begin to feel disconnected from the people around them. Someone who is struggling or in-crisis has gone beyond their capacity for self-care. They may be experiencing emotional distress or emotional numbness. They may withdraw, isolate, or avoid meaningful activities. Someone in crisis may be experiencing distressing mental health symptoms that are impairing their ability to engage in work, home, social life, or spiritual practices. People experiencing this level of vicarious trauma often need community care and/or professional support. Bring participants attention to the second column “personal indicators.” For the next several minutes, prompt participants to reflect on the questions: “What is life like when your mental health is thriving? How do you feel? What activities are you engaged in? What do your relationships look like?” Instruct participants to write a few words that describe this state of “thriving” in the associated box. The remainder of the workshop will be spent focusing on the signs and symptoms of vicarious trauma. Ask participants to identify experiences that resonate for them as you review the signs & symptoms of vicarious trauma in the following slides. Give participants a few moments at the end of each slide to note these in the boxes associated with “surviving,” and “struggling.” Advise participants that if they have never experienced the feeling of being in-crisis, that’s great! Have them consider how they might know if they were in the future. Planning ahead for noticing signs can be a powerful tool in healing and wellness. DEEP DIVE: VICARIOUS TRAUMA - 10 MINUTESUnderstanding Signs & Symptoms of Vicarious TraumaMATERIALS• Facilitator slidesINSTRUCTIONS If you think of trauma as information, vicarious trauma is information overload. There is a limit to what we are able to take in and process. The stories of trauma and suffering start to fill us up and can become part of us. Vicarious trauma is a human response to the experience of coming face-to-face with the reality of trauma and the difficulties of the human experience. It can slowly shift our outlook and deny us the perspective of a world that exists beyond the traumatic experience. Despite your best efforts, VT may still be experienced. This doesn’t mean you’ve done anything wrong or that your self-care isn’t “good enough,” just like trauma, vicarious trauma is a physiological response that we can mitigate, but can not always control. Instead, we can feel empowered to understand warning signs so that we can respond compassionately to ourselves should we experience it.Slide 10 : Changes in Worldview/Belief SystemVicarious trauma is unique from more general workplace stress because of the way it can fundamentally transform the way we view ourselves and the world. People immersed in trauma-adjacent work may begin to shift their belief systems. Some changes in belief may be positive, and a reflection of the vicarious resilience discussed earlier. However, a shift to pervasive cynicism, hopelessness, over-identification with ones’ professional role, or a decreased ability to access a sense of safety either in our environment or in ourselves may indicate the presence of vicarious trauma. Examples: • Upon entering the field, you may have felt optimistic and full of big ideas. Now you feel that nothing can be done to improve the issues negatively impacting your community or to change he negative conditions of the education system. • You used to have a variety of interests and hobbies that were central to how you moved through the world. Perhaps you were a basketball player, a writer, a bird enthusiast, or a painter. Now it is hard to imagine viewing yourself in any role outside of your trauma work. Slide 11: Psychological/Emotional The psychological and emotional toll of trauma work can show up as a heightened sensitivity and emotional intensity or as the other side of the same coin in the form of emotional numbing and minimizing. People experiencing vicarious trauma may notice they have an increasingly difficult time managing distress--this may look like increased tearfulness, anxiety, or an inability to tolerate the intense emotions of others. Some people may experience a disconnection from their emotional experiences. Having chronically been exposed to the effects of trauma, their way of coping is to disconnect from their own internal experiences in order to “push through,” and avoid. This may also lead to symptoms of depression or inability to find pleasure in one’s life. Examples: • You may find yourself constantly on guard or bracing yourself for the next crisis. • You could have a difficult time accessing empathy when a student or colleague shares about a stressful or traumatic event in their life. • You may share common identity or community with the students you teach. Perhaps you grew up in the same neighborhood, share a marginalized identity, or experienced your own childhood trauma and now find yourself feeling guilty for your own survival. Slide12: SomaticThe physiological response to trauma is an intensely somatic experience. When we are threatened we go into fight, flight, or freeze mode, our survival brains take over, and we experience an enormous surge of energy. What is left over of that energy is expressed through physical movements like trembling or crying. When this process is inhibited, it leads to dysregulation of the nervous system. This may result in physical symptoms such as digestive problems and sleep disturbances. Slide 13: BehavioralPeople experiencing vicarious trauma may exhibit certain behaviors in an attempt to cope. Examples of such behaviors are included here. These behaviors can develop as a way to self-soothe or to “check out” from the emotional pain.Examples: • You may find excuses to avoid routine staff meetings that you used to attend with no issue. • You may notice an increase in arguments with your partner or find yourself having big reactions to what would previously have been minor conflicts. • You could find yourself feeling the need to routinely decompress with drugs or alcohol in order to “turn off” your work mind. Slide 14: RelationalYour role as an educator is fundamentally relational in nature. When these relationships are also impacted by the presence of individual and collective trauma, it may affect the way the educator engages with those around them. They may find it difficult to form nourishing relationships, avoid intimacy, feel the need to be self-sufficient, or feel unable to meaningfully connect with people who are not in a similar helping profession. Examples: • You may find that nearly all of your social interactions are with colleagues or others in the helping professions. You may find it difficult to relate or may even find yourself judging people who are not in a similar field.• You may find yourself taking on a large amount of extra tasks “for the sake of the students,” and have a hard time receiving assistance even when it is offered. • You may notice a decrease in pleasure in your partnerships or friendships. Included in the content notes of each slide are examples of ways these signs and symptoms may emerge. You may wish to choose one or two to support participants in making connections between clinical language and personal experiences. BACKGROUNDvan Dernoot Lipsky, Laura. (2009). Trauma Stewardship.

SELF-ASSESSMENT - 10 MINUTESPro-QOLMATERIALS• ProQOL5 Self-Assessment WorksheetsINSTRUCTIONSSelf-AssessmentGive participants brief background on the Pro-QOL. The Professional Quality of Life Measure (Pro-QOL) is a free resource developed by researchers, educators, and clinicians. It is used to take inventory of one’s compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary/vicarious trauma. Distribute a copy of Pro-QOL 5, Self-Score to all participants. Instruct participants to spend the next 7-8 minutes completing the self-assessment to take inventory on the ways exposure to secondary trauma is currently affecting them. Taking inventory in this way can help in creating a plan for healing and care that specifically addresses the impact. If you will be following this session with Vicarious Trauma Part II, request participants bring their ProQOL to the next session. Assure participants that the next session will be entirely focused on responding to †he question of “now what?” and explore a variety of strategies for responding to vicarious trauma both individually and collectively. If you are unable to provide Vicarious Trauma Part II as follow-up to this session, encourage participants to utilize the results from the Pro-QOL to engage in a practice of setting intentional goals for self and community care. A useful tool for guiding this practice is exploring the “Five Directions” found in Laura Van Dernoot Lipsky’s, “Trauma Stewardship.”BACKGROUNDB. Hudnall Stamm (2009).

OverviewBegin by sharing this quote by Nakita Valerio (award-winning writer, academic, and community organizer based in Edmonton, Canada.): “Shouting ‘self-care’ at people who actually need community care is how we fail people.”Slide 17: How we choose to care for ourselves has an impact on our overall health, which makes self-care practice important. However assuming that people always have the capability, accessibility, or power to care for themselves is flawed. True healing requires an approach that is responsive to this. Today we will discuss strategies for self-care, and we will also go further to identify strategies for community care & systemic change to prevent or alleviate distress related to vicarious trauma.", "chunks": ["WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE? - 8 MINUTESCreating shared language & context for exploring vicarious traumaMATERIALS• Facilitator SlidesINSTRUCTIONSSlide 4: Vicarious trauma and burnout are terms often terms used interchangeably; however there are key distinctions between them. Slide 5: Burnout.Ask participants, “who has heard the term burnout? What causes it? What options are there for addressing it?” Explain “we often hear the term “burnout” being used to describe educators’ experiences. While burnout is very common in education & healthcare fields, there is a tendency to conflate it with vicarious trauma which we will get into in a moment. Burnout can occur in any professional or educational setting and is characterized by a depleted ability to cope with work/life demands.”Slide 6: Compassion Fatigue & Vicarious Trauma.The remainder of this is workshop focused on vicarious trauma. The tendency to conflate this with burnout leaves folks experiencing vicarious trauma feeling isolated, misunderstood, and frustrated--particularly when they have employed all of the typical recommendations for managing burnout “take a break, go outside, run a bath” with little effect. While these may be useful strategies for self care, it is important for people working in trauma-impacted environments are provided information and support in managing vicarious trauma. Vicarious trauma & compassion fatigue are terms often used interchangeably to explain the inner-experience of the helper resulting from empathetic engagement with traumatized clients or communities.” Using the definitions included in the slide, discuss with participants that while related, they both describe slightly different experiences.Slide 7: Vicarious Resilience. Vicarious resilience happens when educators (or other helping professionals) experience personal growth in their own life through witnessing the growth of their students. Witnessing students or their families overcome adversity has a positive effect on the professionals supporting them. An educators’ own beliefs and feelings can change and allow them to reassess their own problems and are better able to cope with their own adversity.

PMID: 17593887.REFLECT & SHARE - 5 MINUTESJournal & Group shareMATERIALS• Paper• Writing Utensil INSTRUCTIONSReflectAsk participants to take a few moments to reflect on their work in a trauma-impacted environment. They may choose to reflect through writing, drawing, or thinking about answers to the following prompts: • How has your work in", "drawing, or thinking about answers to the following prompts: • How has your work in a trauma-impacted school has had a positive influence on the way you see the world, yourself, or what matters to you (your sense of meaning and purpose, hope and faith)?• How has your work in a trauma-impacted school has had a negative or challenging influence on the way you see the world, yourself, or what matters to you?ShareIn small groups of 3-4, or as a large group; give participants an opportunity to share something that came up for them during the exercise. Participants may choose to share an answer to one of the prompts, or share more broadly about what it was like to reflect in this way. This exercise may be one of the few times participants have explicitly been asked to reflect on the challenges of trauma work. It will be important for you to hold a non-judgmental & empathetic space for sharing. If you choose to have participants share in the large group, acknowledge participants’ willingness to share by validating, normalizing and thanking them for their responses. If participants will share in small groups, you will want to encourage listeners in each group to maintain curiosity & empathy for their colleague as well as avoid using this time for problem-solving/advice-giving, or one-upping (i.e. “if you think that’s bad, you won’t believe what happened to me...”)MY MENTAL HEALTH CONTINUUM - 10 MINUTESIndividual Care PlanMATERIALS• “My Mental Health Continuum” Worksheet• Writing utensilINSTRUCTIONSProvide participants with “My Mental Health Continuum” worksheet. Explain that mental health is something everyone has and that it is not a fixed experience. Mental health changes occur in response to the interdependent workings of our internal experiences, external stressors or pleasures, and the environments we are immersed in. For this exercise, we will be reflecting on the ways our own mental health shifts and create a plan that is responsive to those shifts. Review the three categories “thriving,” “surviving,” and “struggling/in-crisis.” Someone who is thriving is able to experience pleasure, successfully utilize a wide range of strategies to respond to life’s challenges, attend to the present while planning for the future, and meaningfully engage in relationships that are important to them. Someone who is surviving is focused on just making it through the day. They are at the limits of their capacity for self-care. They may often be worrying about the inevitable", "the limits of their capacity for self-care. They may often be worrying about the inevitable next crisis rather than remain present in the moment. They may find it challenging to engage in the activities they usually enjoy and begin to feel disconnected from the people around them. Someone who is struggling or in-crisis has gone beyond their capacity for self-care. They may be experiencing emotional distress or emotional numbness. They may withdraw, isolate, or avoid meaningful activities. Someone in crisis may be experiencing distressing mental health symptoms that are impairing their ability to engage in work, home, social life, or spiritual practices. People experiencing this level of vicarious trauma often need community care and/or professional support. Bring participants attention to the second column “personal indicators.” For the next several minutes, prompt participants to reflect on the questions: “What is life like when your mental health is thriving? How do you feel? What activities are you engaged in? What do your relationships look like?” Instruct participants to write a few words that describe this state of “thriving” in the associated box. The remainder of the workshop will be spent focusing on the signs and symptoms of vicarious trauma. Ask participants to identify experiences that resonate for them as you review the signs & symptoms of vicarious trauma in the following slides. Give participants a few moments at the end of each slide to note these in the boxes associated with “surviving,” and “struggling.” Advise participants that if they have never experienced the feeling of being in-crisis, that’s great! Have them consider how they might know if they were in the future. Planning ahead for noticing signs can be a powerful tool in healing and wellness. DEEP DIVE: VICARIOUS TRAUMA - 10 MINUTESUnderstanding Signs & Symptoms of Vicarious TraumaMATERIALS• Facilitator slidesINSTRUCTIONS If you think of trauma as information, vicarious trauma is information overload. There is a limit to what we are able to take in and process. The stories of trauma and suffering start to fill us up and can become part of us. Vicarious trauma is a human response to the experience of coming face-to-face with the reality of trauma and the difficulties of the human experience. It can slowly shift our outlook and deny us the perspective of a world that exists beyond the traumatic experience. Despite your best efforts, VT may still be experienced. This doesn’t mean you’ve done", "experience. Despite your best efforts, VT may still be experienced. This doesn’t mean you’ve done anything wrong or that your self-care isn’t “good enough,” just like trauma, vicarious trauma is a physiological response that we can mitigate, but can not always control. Instead, we can feel empowered to understand warning signs so that we can respond compassionately to ourselves should we experience it.Slide 10 : Changes in Worldview/Belief SystemVicarious trauma is unique from more general workplace stress because of the way it can fundamentally transform the way we view ourselves and the world. People immersed in trauma-adjacent work may begin to shift their belief systems. Some changes in belief may be positive, and a reflection of the vicarious resilience discussed earlier. However, a shift to pervasive cynicism, hopelessness, over-identification with ones’ professional role, or a decreased ability to access a sense of safety either in our environment or in ourselves may indicate the presence of vicarious trauma. Examples: • Upon entering the field, you may have felt optimistic and full of big ideas. Now you feel that nothing can be done to improve the issues negatively impacting your community or to change he negative conditions of the education system. • You used to have a variety of interests and hobbies that were central to how you moved through the world. Perhaps you were a basketball player, a writer, a bird enthusiast, or a painter. Now it is hard to imagine viewing yourself in any role outside of your trauma work. Slide 11: Psychological/Emotional The psychological and emotional toll of trauma work can show up as a heightened sensitivity and emotional intensity or as the other side of the same coin in the form of emotional numbing and minimizing. People experiencing vicarious trauma may notice they have an increasingly difficult time managing distress--this may look like increased tearfulness, anxiety, or an inability to tolerate the intense emotions of others. Some people may experience a disconnection from their emotional experiences. Having chronically been exposed to the effects of trauma, their way of coping is to disconnect from their own internal experiences in order to “push through,” and avoid. This may also lead to symptoms of depression or inability to find pleasure in one’s life. Examples: • You may find yourself constantly on guard or bracing yourself for the next crisis. • You could have a difficult time accessing empathy when a student", "the next crisis. • You could have a difficult time accessing empathy when a student or colleague shares about a stressful or traumatic event in their life. • You may share common identity or community with the students you teach. Perhaps you grew up in the same neighborhood, share a marginalized identity, or experienced your own childhood trauma and now find yourself feeling guilty for your own survival. Slide12: SomaticThe physiological response to trauma is an intensely somatic experience. When we are threatened we go into fight, flight, or freeze mode, our survival brains take over, and we experience an enormous surge of energy. What is left over of that energy is expressed through physical movements like trembling or crying. When this process is inhibited, it leads to dysregulation of the nervous system. This may result in physical symptoms such as digestive problems and sleep disturbances. Slide 13: BehavioralPeople experiencing vicarious trauma may exhibit certain behaviors in an attempt to cope. Examples of such behaviors are included here. These behaviors can develop as a way to self-soothe or to “check out” from the emotional pain.Examples: • You may find excuses to avoid routine staff meetings that you used to attend with no issue. • You may notice an increase in arguments with your partner or find yourself having big reactions to what would previously have been minor conflicts. • You could find yourself feeling the need to routinely decompress with drugs or alcohol in order to “turn off” your work mind. Slide 14: RelationalYour role as an educator is fundamentally relational in nature. When these relationships are also impacted by the presence of individual and collective trauma, it may affect the way the educator engages with those around them. They may find it difficult to form nourishing relationships, avoid intimacy, feel the need to be self-sufficient, or feel unable to meaningfully connect with people who are not in a similar helping profession. Examples: • You may find that nearly all of your social interactions are with colleagues or others in the helping professions. You may find it difficult to relate or may even find yourself judging people who are not in a similar field.• You may find yourself taking on a large amount of extra tasks “for the sake of the students,” and have a hard time receiving assistance even when it is offered. • You may notice a decrease", "hard time receiving assistance even when it is offered. • You may notice a decrease in pleasure in your partnerships or friendships. Included in the content notes of each slide are examples of ways these signs and symptoms may emerge. You may wish to choose one or two to support participants in making connections between clinical language and personal experiences. BACKGROUNDvan Dernoot Lipsky, Laura. (2009). Trauma Stewardship.

SELF-ASSESSMENT - 10 MINUTESPro-QOLMATERIALS• ProQOL5 Self-Assessment WorksheetsINSTRUCTIONSSelf-AssessmentGive participants brief background on the Pro-QOL. The Professional Quality of Life Measure (Pro-QOL) is a free resource developed by researchers, educators, and clinicians. It is used to take inventory of one’s compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary/vicarious trauma. Distribute a copy of Pro-QOL 5, Self-Score to all participants. Instruct participants to spend the next 7-8 minutes completing the self-assessment to take inventory on the ways exposure to secondary trauma is currently affecting them. Taking inventory in this way can help in creating a plan for healing and care that specifically addresses the impact. If you will be following this session with Vicarious Trauma Part II, request participants bring their ProQOL to the next session. Assure participants that the next session will be entirely focused on responding to †he question of “now what?” and explore a variety of strategies for responding to vicarious trauma both individually and collectively. If you are unable to provide Vicarious Trauma Part II as follow-up to this session, encourage participants to utilize the results from the Pro-QOL to engage in a practice of setting intentional goals for self and community care.

Centering the concept of community care in the workplace requires both individual and structural work. A concept called Low Impact debriefing is one tool that can be used to avoid Retraumatization and promote community care in relationships between colleagues (and can be useful to use when debriefing your work with others as well). When educators are exposed to stressful things in the course of their work, it is a normal reaction to want to debrief with someone. Low impact debriefing allows us to access support and validation while simultaneously caring for the person offering it to us. Low Impact Debriefing includes the following four principles: 1. Self-Awareness: Understanding why I am sharing and what I hope to get from the interaction. Naming this can improve the efficacy of the debrief. For example:1. “I am not ready to problem solve, I just want someone to validate how upsetting this situation was,” 2. “I need help transitioning out of work so that I can be present with my child this afternoon.”2. Content Warning: It is common in daily life to preface sharing bad news with a pause such as “I need you to sit down, I have something I need to tell you.” The same need exists in debriefs. Let’s imagine your colleague asks “how was your day?” and you’ve just had a day where you had to file a CPS report after a student wrote about being abused in their writing assignment. In order to provide a content warning, you might first give a simple answer such as “it was really hard,” or “I’m so upset about something that happened.” However, before you give details, you might say “I’d like to share something that is pretty upsetting,” or “I had to make a CPS report and it’s hard to get the details out of my mind.” This gives the person a moment to ready themselves for the information if they are able to hear it. 3. Consent: After providing a content warning, you will need to obtain consent. This means asking if someone is available to hear the content and to provide emotional support. It is important when asking for consent that we give space and permission for the person to answer. Only after we have obtained consent should we continue to the next step. If the person does not consent, it is important to acknowledge this and to respect the boundary. Asking for consent might sound like: 1. “Do you have capacity for me to share about what happened today?”2. “I’d like to debrief something with you, are you available for that?” 4. Limited disclosure: When you share, begin with the least traumatic content and gradually get nearer to the more intense content. Consider what details are necessary to share. In the end, you may not need to tell the graphic details. In times when you need to share details ensure that you are maintaining confidentiality and the person who you are debriefing with is appropriate.

Centering the concept of community care in the workplace requires both individual and structural work. A concept called Low Impact debriefing is one tool that can be used to avoid Retraumatization and promote community care in relationships between colleagues (and can be useful to use when debriefing your work with others as well). When educators are exposed to stressful things in the course of their work, it is a normal reaction to want to debrief with someone. Low impact debriefing allows us to access support and validation while simultaneously caring for the person offering it to us. Low Impact Debriefing includes the following four principles: 1. Self-Awareness: Understanding why I am sharing and what I hope to get from the interaction. Naming this can improve the efficacy of the debrief. For example:1. “I am not ready to problem solve, I just want someone to validate how upsetting this situation was,” 2. “I need help transitioning out of work so that I can be present with my child this afternoon.”2. Content Warning: It is common in daily life to preface sharing bad news with a pause such as “I need you to sit down, I have something I need to tell you.” The same need exists in debriefs. Let’s imagine your colleague asks “how was your day?” and you’ve just had a day where you had to file a CPS report after a student wrote about being abused in their writing assignment. In order to provide a content warning, you might first give a simple answer such as “it was really hard,” or “I’m so upset about something that happened.” However, before you give details, you might say “I’d like to share something that is pretty upsetting,” or “I had to make a CPS report and it’s hard to get the details out of my mind.” This gives the person a moment to ready themselves for the information if they are able to hear it. 3. Consent: After providing a content warning, you will need to obtain consent. This means asking if someone is available to hear the content and to provide emotional support. It is important when asking for consent that we give space and permission for the person to answer. Only after we have obtained consent should we continue to the next step.", "to answer. Only after we have obtained consent should we continue to the next step. If the person does not consent, it is important to acknowledge this and to respect the boundary. Asking for consent might sound like: 1. “Do you have capacity for me to share about what happened today?”2. “I’d like to debrief something with you, are you available for that?” 4. Limited disclosure: When you share, begin with the least traumatic content and gradually get nearer to the more intense content. Consider what details are necessary to share. In the end, you may not need to tell the graphic details. In times when you need to share details ensure that you are maintaining confidentiality and the person who you are debriefing with is appropriate. Especially consider focusing on the impact the event had on you, rather than on giving the other person all of the specific details. BACKGROUNDSaakvitne, K. and Pearlman, L. (2016).

Lack of emotion regulation is a developmental gap. In a child’s ideal development, emotion regulation is a skill learned both implicitly and explicitly. For some people who had highly attuned and regulated caregivers, strategies for emotion regulation were built simply by observing and replicating a caregiver modeling it. However, this is often not what happens either because a caregiver was unable to provide that attunement and/or because the caregiving occurred in a chronically stressful environment with little reprieve to practice it. Students who have a developmental trauma history likely did not intuitively develop this skill. It is important to remember that for most students if they can, they will--emotion dysregulation is uncomfortable. A lack of emotion regulation is a developmental gap that needs to be addressed just like any other gap in academic skills. 2. Our most important teaching tool are ourselves.Because many of us were not explicitly taught, we may not have a model for how to teach others. This can create anxiety, feelings of incompetence, etc. These feelings, if left unattended to, can lead to own dysregulation which can interact with students’ dysregulation. This back and forth dysregulation leaves us without a way to mindfully relate to one another. 3. Emotion regulation skills are necessary for learning Emotion regulation is necessary for the development of complex problem-solving skills, memory functioning, attention and focus, and making novel connections.

This means that we begin first by turning inward, identifying and responding to our own emotions in order to foster a space where others can do the same. Understanding ModelingOne powerful tool in teaching emotion regulation is modeling. Modeling is beneficial because it is relational, interactive, and doesn’t require any special lesson plans or additional class time. As educators, we can practice this regularly as a way to both teach emotion regulation as well as share in ways that allow us to be known by our students. We can do this in the moments we feel happy, frustrated, disappointed and anywhere in between. For example, if we get stuck in traffic on the way to school and arrive without time for our usual prep, we might say “I feel a little anxious because I was caught in traffic and wasn’t able to make the photocopies we were going to use this morning. I’m going to take a few moments to breathe while you all complete the do-now so that the rest of our time together can feel less frazzled.” Name your own feelings and connect them to behaviors regularly.Practice!In a small group, pick one feeling you brought with you to work this week & practice connecting it to a thought and/or behavior.Reframing PraiseIn addition to modeling, educators can also shift their framework. Instead of rewarding behavior i.e. “thank-you for completing your math homework today;” reward students by reflecting back the social-emotional skills they used to get to the behavior. For example “you were really frustrated with the homework yesterday and you found a way to get it turned in today. I’m really proud of you!” Or “great job letting me know when you were feeling bored and finding a way to stay focused by using that fidget during the lesson.” Thank you for noticing that you were upset and taking some space so we could have a calm conversation about it.”RESPOND - 7 MINUTESMATERIALS• Survival Brain-->Learning Brain Cards• Elevator Empathy WorksheetsINSTRUCTIONSBegin first by providing information about the DNA process (Bailey 2001). Once an educator becomes the thermostat, they are more readily available to notice and respond to students experiencing moments of dysregulation. One strategy covered today is known as DNA. DNA stands for “describe, notice & name, and acknowledge.” 1. Describe: This involves describing objective, observable behavior. For example “your head is down on your desk,” or “your face is all scrunched like this [mirror back to them.]” Describe can be both verbal as well as non-verbal. Non-verbal mirroring can be useful when students are dysregulated and having a difficult time hearing what you are saying. We describe in a neutral, calm tone and the same is true in mirroring--we repeat the behavior back to them without any theatrics or exaggeration.2. Pause: After describing, you will often want to take a pause. Here we can engage students through co-regulation. We may take a deep breath, sit calmly next to them, lower our shoulders, etc. in an attempt to support students’ ability to regulate their nervous system. 3. Notice & Name: Notice & name the emotion you are seeing. “You’re disappointed,” or “I can see that you’re frustrated.” 4. Acknowledge: Next, quickly acknowledge what the child wanted or the unmet need. It is important to notice & acknowledge in quick succession of each other in order to support the student in developing the ability to link events with feelings. For example “you’re disappointed, you wanted to keep playing on the swingset,” or “I can see that you’re frustrated, you were unsure about the answer to the math problem”It’s important to note that the antecedent or the feelings attached may be unknown by the educator. However, making a guess and allowing space to be corrected by the student can be just as useful. Just acknowledging that a student is having a challenging feeling can be validating, even when it takes several attempts to identify it. When a student provides a correction, i.e. “I’m angry, not sad;” continue without pause to reflect this back “oh, thanks for letting me know. Mary took the pencil without asking and you’re feeling really angry about it.” PRACTICE! - 8 MINUTESINSTRUCTIONSElevator EmpathyIn pairs, complete the elevator empathy (page 11 in workbook) activity together. Spend several minutes as a full group sharing possible responses to each of the scenarios. LEARNING BRAIN - 20 MINUTESINSTRUCTIONSPutting It All TogetherThe process of DNA supports students to move out of a “survival brain,” into conscious awareness of their emotions. Once the student has shifted out of survival brain and into this awareness, it is time to support them in making a choice about what to do with that emotion. Offering choice and empowering students to have agency is an important piece of trauma-informed care and of teaching effective self management skills. Educators can do this in a number of ways and do not need to remove academic rigor in order to accomplish it. A choice might be “you can skip that question for now and come back to it later or I can help you with it now;” or “would you rather take the assignment to a quiet room to finish or join the rest of the class?” It is important to note that for some students in a highly escalated state, the process to return to equilibrium can be a lengthy one. This is why it will be important to have a school-wide trauma-informed plan in place. An educator may be able to reduce escalation and notice that a student still needs time before they are able to return to academics. If this is the case, they may be offered an in-classroom option “i.e. you can take 10 minutes in the calm corner or at your desk with this mindfulness video” or an out of the classroom option “you can take 10 minutes in the calm room or sitting with Ms. Matias in the main office until you’re ready to return.”Practice!Participants will now practice joining all parts of the de-escalation process together. Divide participants into groups of 4-5. Each group will be given a set of cards--each representing a different part of the de-escalation process, as well as a set of scenarios. 1. Survival Brain: This represents the “D” in DNA. Simply describe the behavior you notice. This can be done verbally & non-verbally. 2. Pause: The process of coregulation. Practice taking a breath or doing other self-regulatory practices in order to be able to move through the next pieces calmly.3. Emotion Brain: This represents the “N” & “A” of DNA. First notice & name the antecedent and then quickly acknowledge the feeling. 4. Learning Brain: The process of shifting back into conscious decision making. Offer a choice here that is aligned with your classroom/school’s values, norms, and expectations.Instruct participants to each take one of the cards and to physically put themselves in order from “Survival Brain” -->”Pause”-->”Emotion Brain” --> “Learning Brain.” Ask for one person to read the scenario aloud to the group. Each person will then give a response from their part of the process. Rotate through roles until each member has been given at least one opportunity to practice in each. Facilitators may wish to ask for four volunteers to demonstrate the activity in front of the full group before breaking off into small groups to practice. Applying DNA to a GroupExpand on the topic of de-escalation by acknowledging that escalation is not reserved for individual students, but can also have a wider community impact. Educators can apply similar principals and strategies when responding to a group. When a group of students is escalated and/or impacted by a classroom disruption, educators can use this as an opportunity for modeling, utilizing DNA, and engaging the full group in a brief emotion regulation activity to return to a state of calm. An example of this might sound like: “Sam was upset so he left the class. I notice many of you moving around in your seats without pencils in your hands. You’re probably feeling a bit distracted. Let’s all take a minute to stand up at our desks and shake out our hands & feet.” CLOSING - 8 MINUTESINSTRUCTIONSHomework: Ask participants to identify students who show difficulty managing behaviors & often affect other students. These should not be the students who the educator has the most challenges with, but instead someone who falls in the middle. When practicing a new skill, it is usually helpful to do so in less intense scenarios before practicing in a higher stress environment. With the student(s) identified, find opportunities to practice the DNA process with them.

This means that we begin first by turning inward, identifying and responding to our own emotions in order to foster a space where others can do the same. Understanding ModelingOne powerful tool in teaching emotion regulation is modeling. Modeling is beneficial because it is relational, interactive, and doesn’t require any special lesson plans or additional class time. As educators, we can practice this regularly as a way to both teach emotion regulation as well as share in ways that allow us to be known by our students. We can do this in the moments we feel happy, frustrated, disappointed and anywhere in between. For example, if we get stuck in traffic on the way to school and arrive without time for our usual prep, we might say “I feel a little anxious because I was caught in traffic and wasn’t able to make the photocopies we were going to use this morning. I’m going to take a few moments to breathe while you all complete the do-now so that the rest of our time together can feel less frazzled.” Name your own feelings and connect them to behaviors regularly.Practice!In a small group, pick one feeling you brought with you to work this week & practice connecting it to a thought and/or behavior.Reframing PraiseIn addition to modeling, educators can also shift their framework. Instead of rewarding behavior i.e. “thank-you for completing your math homework today;” reward students by reflecting back the social-emotional skills they used to get to the behavior. For example “you were really frustrated with the homework yesterday and you found a way to get it turned in today. I’m really proud of you!” Or “great job letting me know when you were feeling bored and finding a way to stay focused by using that fidget during the lesson.” Thank you for noticing that you were upset and taking some space so we could have a calm conversation about it.”RESPOND - 7 MINUTESMATERIALS• Survival Brain-->Learning Brain Cards• Elevator Empathy WorksheetsINSTRUCTIONSBegin first by providing information about the DNA process (Bailey 2001).

Sensory bins can be made from anything, but generally include a variety of textures/sensations for touch. Sensory bins are commonly made from kinetic sand and hard items such as shells, rocks, or miniature figurines. Next to the bin, set up single-serving candy and/or fruit. Grounding is a particular type of coping strategy that is designed to immediately connect you with the present moment. Grounding is often used as a way of coping with flashbacks or dissociation associated with PTSD. Grounding techniques often use the five senses—sound, touch, smell, taste, and sight—to immediately connect you with the here and now. For example, listening to certain songs, running hands under cold water, or chewing gum are all grounding techniques that produce sensations that are difficult to ignore and can be helpful distractions from distress. 1. With your team, play a game of “I Spy.” One person in the group, share your favorite color. Everybody--identify as many items as you can in that color around the room. 2. Using your sense of touch, spend time noticing what items in the sensory bin feel like. Are they warm or cold? Smooth or rough? Light or heavy? 3. Using all of your senses, taste a piece of candy or fruit. Before placing it in your mouth, notice its color, shape, size. Notice how it smells. Now place it in your mouth. Notice how it feels like on your tongue. Notice how it tastes.

Suggested YouTube channels to pull from are: MyLife, Headspace, The Mental Health Teacher, or Calm. Several of these also have associated apps that are free for use in schools. When you experience a stressful event, your body automatically goes into survival mode. Your heart rate increases, your stomach stops digestion, and your breathing becomes more shallow.The goal of calming exercises is to get oneself from “flight, fight or freeze” mode back to a peaceful neutrality. Deep breathing helps get more oxygen into the bloodstream, opening up capillaries. It has a physical effect on your body to help you calm and lower stress by regulating the nervous system.Deep breathing does make a big difference. It is a tool that can be used anywhere, anytime! Other people will probably not even notice someone using this tool. Taking short quick breaths actually increases other feelings of anxiety (e.g. heart racing, dizziness, or headaches). Calm breathing will slow down breathing. Practice! Using the mindful breathing worksheet, choose 2-3 different breathing exercises to try.

Sensory bins can be made from anything, but generally include a variety of textures/sensations for touch. Sensory bins are commonly made from kinetic sand and hard items such as shells, rocks, or miniature figurines. Next to the bin, set up single-serving candy and/or fruit. Grounding is a particular type of coping strategy that is designed to immediately connect you with the present moment. Grounding is often used as a way of coping with flashbacks or dissociation associated with PTSD. Grounding techniques often use the five senses—sound, touch, smell, taste, and sight—to immediately connect you with the here and now. For example, listening to certain songs, running hands under cold water, or chewing gum are all grounding techniques that produce sensations that are difficult to ignore and can be helpful distractions from distress. 1. With your team, play a game of “I Spy.” One person in the group, share your favorite color. Everybody--identify as many items as you can in that color around the room. 2. Using your sense of touch, spend time noticing what items in the sensory bin feel like. Are they warm or cold? Smooth or rough? Light or heavy? 3. Using all of your senses, taste a piece of candy or fruit. Before placing it in your mouth, notice its color, shape, size. Notice how it smells. Now place it in your mouth. Notice how it feels like on your tongue. Notice how it tastes.

MINDFUL BREATHING - 7 MINUTESMATERIALS• Mindful Breathing Worksheet• Mindfulness Video (optional)• Bubbles (optional)• Comfortable bolsters, yoga mats, pillows, etc. (optional)INSTRUCTIONSSet-Up: (optional) Pre-load a short mindfulness video onto a computer or tablet. Suggested YouTube channels to pull from are: MyLife, Headspace, The Mental Health Teacher, or Calm. Several of these also have associated apps that are free for use in schools. When you experience a stressful event, your body automatically goes into survival mode. Your heart rate increases, your stomach stops digestion, and your breathing becomes more shallow.The goal of calming exercises is to get oneself from “flight, fight or freeze” mode back to a peaceful neutrality. Deep breathing helps get more oxygen into the bloodstream, opening up capillaries. It has a physical effect on your body to help you calm and lower stress by regulating the nervous system.Deep breathing does make a big difference. It is a tool that can be used anywhere, anytime! Other people will probably not even notice someone using this tool. Taking short quick breaths actually increases other feelings of anxiety (e.g. heart racing, dizziness, or headaches). Calm breathing will slow down breathing. Practice! Using the mindful breathing worksheet, choose 2-3 different breathing exercises to try. If available to you, watch & follow along to one of the mindfulness videos.

A high-impact event is a traumatic event that affects multiple people in the school community and significantly disrupts our coping and problem-solving abilities. It is typically sudden, unexpected, and threatening to sense of safety. It may create a sense of helplessness, hopelessness and vulnerability. (example: a student fight, sudden loss in the community, school lockdown, etc.)A mental health crisis is a non-life-threatening situation in which an individual is exhibiting extreme emotional disturbance or behavioral distress, considering harm to self or others, disoriented or out of touch with reality, has a compromised ability to function, or is otherwise agitated and unable to be calmed. (example: threatening harm to self or others with no immediate access to means and not actively attempting to do so)A mental health emergency is a life-threatening situation in which an individual is imminently threatening harm to self or others, severely disorientated or out of touch with reality, has a severe inability to function, or is otherwise distraught and out of control (actively attempting to harm others or self; if harm to others, is not better understood as a mutual conflict)REFLECTING ON CURRENT PRACTICES - 20 MINUTESMATERIALS• Poster Paper with labels “Before” “During” and “After/Recovery” (create 2 columns on each labeled “strengths” and “opportunities for change”)• Paper• Writing Utensils• Sticky Notes• Markers or Colored Pencils• PaperINSTRUCTIONSCase ExamplesDistribute paper, writing & art supplies, and sticky notes around the room.

Strategies for effective intervention include: • Self Regulation: Focus on your own emotion regulation in order to support everyone involved to return to equilibrium• Manage the environment: Remove potential hazards, clear area of audience/”bystanders,” identify escape routes, identify unsafe areas, separate from the trigger if possible• Maintain nonjudgment & empathy: Utilize DNA model, offer empathy, avoid blaming or confronting those engaged in harmful behaviors. For example rather than stating: “you’re being disrespectful. You’re unsafe,” name the behavior instead “punching someone is unsafe.”• Avoid unnecessary triggers• Respect Personal Space: Unless the situation is an emergency requiring hands on intervention (which should be done by someone trained in this type of de-escalation), maintaining a distance of 1.5-3 ft (close, but not right next to) prevents immediate confrontation & reduces risk for escalation, increases chance of nonviolent de-escalation, and allows space for maintaining one’s own self-regulation• Practice co-regulation & use calm voice• Ignore power struggle--don’t argue or try to reason, don’t become defensive• Set limits clearly & concisely: for example “set down the scissors.” “you are doing a great job calming down, if you run down the hallway again, I will follow you to make sure that you’re able to stay safe.” “it’s ok to use your words to tell me how angry you are, but I won’t let you push me.”• Allow for silence: As all involved are calming down, resist the urge to jump into reasoning/conversation.

It can be challenging to hold space for recovery after the escalation moment has passed. However, without attending to the lingering impact of the event, relationships remain unstable and the potential for additional harm exists.

You’re unsafe,” name the behavior instead “punching someone is unsafe.”• Avoid unnecessary triggers• Respect Personal Space: Unless the situation is an emergency requiring hands on intervention (which should be done by someone trained in this type of de-escalation), maintaining a distance of 1.5-3 ft (close, but not right next to) prevents immediate confrontation & reduces risk for escalation, increases chance of nonviolent de-escalation, and allows space for maintaining one’s own self-regulation• Practice co-regulation & use calm voice• Ignore power struggle--don’t argue or try to reason, don’t become defensive• Set limits clearly & concisely: for example “set down the scissors.” “you are doing a great job calming down, if you run down the hallway again, I will follow you to make sure that you’re able to stay safe.” “it’s ok to use your words to tell me how angry you are, but I won’t let you push me.”• Allow for silence: As all involved are calming down, resist the urge to jump into reasoning/conversation. Allow for silence and extended time for emotion regulation• Offer options• Work as a team• If student is able, to allow them to choose an available safe adult advocate/responderRECOVER - 3 MINUTESMATERIALS• Facilitator SlidesINSTRUCTIONSSlide 10: Recovery from a high impact event is just as important as immediate intervention and is often the phase of crisis response that is overlooked.

By encouraging staff wellness, sick days can be decreased, insurance costs can be lowered, and employee retention can be increased. Additionally, a healthy school staff can act as role models for the health of their students. Attending to the health of teachers and school staff not only supports these valuable and hard-working professionals, it can improve student health. School staff act as role models for healthy behavior and create better learning environments when they are healthier and less stressed. School-based health centers (SBHCs) have an opportunity to lead staff wellness initiatives that create a culture of health and wellness, build strong partnerships with school sites, and increase clinic utilization. By providing staff wellness services to your school campus, your SBHC will become more integrated into the school you serve, in turn adding value and sustainability to your SBHC. Staff Wellness: Examples & Recommendations Many options exist for SBHCs to implement staff wellness initiatives. The following examples are organized from low cost, easy to implement to examples that require dedicated staff time. Case Study: Check Your Heart Day Preparation: The Logan Health Center (LHC) in Union City wanted to better engage teachers with their SBHC. They surveyed teachers and discovered that many of them wanted to use health services at LHC. One of the health needs identified in the survey was preventive services, such as immunizations and blood pressure checks. With the help of school partners, LHC staff implemented a “Check Your Heart Day” to coincide with Valentine’s Day. Implementation: The LHC promoted the day through putting flyers in teachers’ mailboxes, sending them email reminders, and presenting during a monthly staff meeting. On “Check Your Heart Day,” the LHC Medical Assistant set up a table in the staff lounge, a convenient and comfortable place for staff to access this resource. The LHC did not host this event in their SBHC, making sure that the students’ space and confidentiality was maintained. Next Steps: “Check Your Heart Day” was so popular amongst school staff, the staff at the LHC decided to make it an annual occurrence. Simple, Low-Cost Ideas The following examples can be easily incorporated into the responsibilities of an SBHC health educator or site director with little or no cost to your SBHC. • Create a monthly or quarterly staff wellness newsletter to be sent out via email or staff mailboxes. The newsletters can include staff wellness tips such as healthy recipes or relaxation techniques. Consider including a profile of a teacher who champions health or supports your SBHC. • Stuff staff mailboxes during the winter with “Staff Wellness Packs” that include tea, tissues, cough drops, and other wellness promoting items. • Ask to have a dedicated health space in the teachers’ lounge sponsored by your SBHC. Fill the space with health brochures, posters, and a place to relax. • Host a staff appreciation day. Provide healthy snacks in the teacher’s lounge or during a staff meeting. • Distribute a list of local organizations and health services that staff can access for free or low cost. This can include mental health services, yoga classes, or locations to get flu shots. • Provide trainings on preventing burnout, vicarious trauma, healthy eating, or stress reduction. Case Study: Weight Loss Challenge Preparation: The San Fernando High School Teen Health Center in San Fernando surveyed school staff on wellness activities at their school as part of their work as a Kaiser Hallways to Health site. They administered this survey electronically over the course of two months at the beginning of the year. With over 70 respondents, the San Fernando High School Teen Health Center staff discovered that many teachers wanted more opportunities for physical activity and healthy snack options at school-sponsored meetings. The health center staff shared their results with their administrative ally, the Vice Principal, who asked the health center staff to host a weight loss challenge at the beginning of January, to coincide with New Year’s resolutions. Implementation: The health center staff began promoting the weight loss challenge through their weekly “Wellness Wednesday” newsletter and recruited 20 teachers to participate. The health center provided a space for teachers to weigh themselves on SBHC scales and provided resources on alternative healthy snacks as well as low cost physical activity opportunities. Next Steps: The San Fernando High School Teen Health Center staff will continue to implement the weight loss challenge on an annual basis for school staff. Increase Your Impact • Host an annual or per semester medical clinic day for staff. Services can include TB Tests, blood pressure checks, and flu shots. • Create a monthly healthy food potluck club for staff. • Start a fitness club with staff. A fitness club can be anything from a lunchtime walking club to regular Zumba classes. • Partner or contract with a local studio or school to provide free meditation, yoga classes, massages, or spa services for staff. • Create water stations for staff and distribute SBHC branded water bottles. • Explicitly include staff wellness in the school and district wellness policies. • Advocate for a policy that healthy foods will be provided at all district related gatherings, including staff meetings and teacher work days. • Support a policy through nutrition/food services to provide lunch to staff for free or at a discounted rate. • Lead wellness activities at school staff meetings (e.g., mindfulness, meditation, or stretch breaks) and advocate for these activities to be a incorporated into meeting agendas. Case Study: Healthy Drinking Water Station Preparation: The JFK Student Health & Enrichment Center in Richmond wanted to promote alternatives to sweetened beverages on their school campus. Although vending machines had been removed from campus many years prior, they noticed that many students and staff were not drinking water because the water fountains were in disrepair or thought to be “dirty.” The health center staff worked with their youth advisory board to survey school staff on whether or not teachers and administrators would drink water from an alternative source, such as a water station. After reviewing the survey results and getting support from their principal, they decided to write a grant to Jamba Juice, to have two water stations created on campus, one for students near the SBHC and one for teachers in their lounge. Implementation: The JFK Student Wellness & Enrichment Center staff received the grant from Jamba Juice and bought two water stations. They are currently working with the school district to install the water stations. Next Steps: Once installed, the SBHC staff will post a sign stating: “Fresh water, provided to you by the JFK Student Wellness & Enrichment Center.” Additionally the health center staff are hoping to order SBHC branded water bottles to distribute to staff. Key Steps for SBHCs 1. Get buy-in from administrators and key staff who will support your efforts. 2. Assess staff needs through a survey or key informant interviews. 3. Review the results and create an action plan with your school partner. 4. Do something and start small! Create your first health newsletter, provide a healthy snack in the teacher’s lounge, or host a fitness class. 5. Obtain feedback, adjust your approach, and keep trying. 6. Make it a regular practice and choose projects or activities that can happen again. Although it is wonderful to have a massage day for teachers, you and your staff should examine budgets to see if this can be an annual occurrence.

They weave together school culture interventions withservices for students utilizing providers and programs across the school in partnershipwith community providers including FQHCs and SBHCs.Many comprehensive school mental health systems use a tiered approach to implementservices and programs. The tiers usually range from universal programs and services forall students aimed at a positive school climate and mental health education, and graduallybecome more targeted and intensive for students needing more individual support. Onewell-known model is the Multi-Tiered System of Support (MTSS), pictured here.School mental health personnel such as School Psychologists, School Social Workersand School Counselors13 are essential in this comprehensive system. When SBHC mentalhealth staff coordinate and integrate their services with school personnel, students canaccess a number of different complementary services and school communities are ableto address their unique needs with the most appropriate level and type of supports. Forexample, school staff implement a schoolwide social-emotional learning curriculum andoffer brief counseling, whereas SBHC staff may provide screening for emotional concernsand substance abuse, while providing more intensive individual and group therapy. Boththese groups can then link students who need ongoing wraparound care to community-based providers with whom they are well connected. The California School Based HealthAlliance fact sheet describes the most common district and community mental healthprovider types and services14.An example of a Tier 1 intervention is this program through Camarena Health whichadvocates for all students to have a better understanding of behavioral health and howit impacts their overall health and well-being. At Madera South High School, Camarenais training peer leaders and the on-campus SBHC to promote mental health access and reducemental health stigma.An example of a Tier 2 intervention is services provided at the James Morehouse Project (JMP),the SBHC at El Cerrito High School in Contra Costa County.

They weave together school culture interventions withservices for students utilizing providers and programs across the school in partnershipwith community providers including FQHCs and SBHCs.Many comprehensive school mental health systems use a tiered approach to implementservices and programs. The tiers usually range from universal programs and services forall students aimed at a positive school climate and mental health education, and graduallybecome more targeted and intensive for students needing more individual support. Onewell-known model is the Multi-Tiered System of Support (MTSS), pictured here.School mental health personnel such as School Psychologists, School Social Workersand School Counselors13 are essential in this comprehensive system. When SBHC mentalhealth staff coordinate and integrate their services with school personnel, students canaccess a number of different complementary services and school communities are ableto address their unique needs with the most appropriate level and type of supports. Forexample, school staff implement a schoolwide social-emotional learning curriculum andoffer brief counseling, whereas SBHC staff may provide screening for emotional concernsand substance abuse, while providing more intensive individual and group therapy. Boththese groups can then link students who need ongoing wraparound care to community-based providers with whom they are well connected. The California School Based HealthAlliance fact sheet describes the most common district and community mental healthprovider types and services14.An example of a Tier 1 intervention is this program through Camarena Health whichadvocates for all students to have a better understanding of behavioral health and howit impacts their overall health and well-being. At Madera South High School, Camarenais training peer leaders and the on-campus SBHC to promote mental health access and reducemental health stigma.An example of a Tier 2 intervention is services provided at the James Morehouse Project (JMP),the SBHC at El Cerrito High School in Contra Costa County.

Adolescents in particulardon’t engage in therapy unless they experience it as supporting them with the needsthey have as they arise. In general, the", "experience it as supporting them with the needsthey have as they arise. In general, the longer they have to wait, the less likely they are toattend a health care visit.In community FQHCs, it is common to staff 1 FTE behavioral health clinician for every 3-4FTE medical providers. In SBHCs, the ratio should tilt much more heavily toward behavioralhealth. Students being seen for medical visits may present behavioral health needs andideally there are ways for a medical provider to make a warm handoff or introduction toa behavioral health clinician. Because of the social-emotional needs related to child andadolescent development, and their relative physical health, a ratio more like two behavioralhealth clinicians for every one medical provider may in fact be more appropriate."]}, "heading_number": 7, "subheading_number": null, "heading_page_number": 34, "excerpt": "<p>Various behavioral health care models in schools have distinct advantages and challenges, with traditional models often facing low productivity and high documentation burdens, while integrated models improve visit volume but may lack quality and patient-centered care.

They may express concern that too narrow a focus on productivitywill endanger quality, documentation, and/or relationship-based care. Thanks to years ofexperience, trial and error, we can now offer these general guidelines:1. Avoid the binary framing of mission vs. money or clinical quality vs. productivity.In fact, maintaining a reasonable productivity standard improves access tocare for more patients, which is core to the mission of most FQHCs and SBHCs.Particularly during a behavioral health workforce shortage and growing mentalhealth need, it is essential to use the valuable time and expertise of behavioralhealth clinicians well.2. Productivity expectations involve clinical decisions and should be establishedby a Behavioral Health Director, ideally one who continues to be in practice ina similar setting. While consultation with the entire leadership team and CFOshould always occur, the BH Director should ultimately drive and endorseproductivity standards.3. Commit to financial sustainability. “No money, no mission” is a commonrefrain in safety net settings. All leaders in integrated environments need tobe committed to the financial health and sustainability of the organizationand its programs. For Behavioral Health Directors, this need is amplified, asbehavioral health services are always combatting a misconception that theyare “auxiliary” services that should be grant funded because they are not self-sustaining. Behavioral health services in all types of primary care settings can infact be profitable and the Behavioral Health Director can elicit the confidenceof other leaders by actively committing to making behavioral health servicescost-neutral or better.4. Use data to inform decision making. In order to review costs and revenues,organizations should regularly run financial reports. The reports should includeappropriate expenses and reimbursements, as well as the productivity ofbehavioral health providers. This data should be transparent and shared withrelevant stakeholders and those who can influence improvements.5. Embrace a team-based care culture so that behavioral health clinicians canbe supported to provide billable visits while other members of the teamoffer outreach, coordination, administrative support for consents and otherdocuments, patient follow-up, data entry, and/or referral linkages.Specific Recommendations for Productivity ExpectationsMost primary care organizations with integrated behavioral health services haveset productivity expectations that range between 6-9 patients a day (or about 100visits a month). In SBHCs generally, it is very difficult for even full-time provider staffto see patients 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week. Schools are frequently impacted byholidays, breaks and other closures, crises and lockdowns, student testing, professionaldevelopment days, and a host of other planned and unplanned interruptions to a“normal” clinical schedule. In addition, SBHC BH clinicians often play a more complicatedand collaborative role than those working in outpatient community-based settings. Theirrole should include liaising with school staff, participating in coordination of servicemeetings, offering some “Tier 1” interventions, training school staff, attending IEPs, andsupporting youth development and other core SBHC activities.For all these reasons, SBHC leaders should expect much lower productivity fromSBHC BH clinicians, in the range of 4-5 a day or 20-25 a week for a full-time clinician.Completing fewer visits limits access to care, and if clinicians feel overwhelmed with thistype of volume, it is important to explore with them what is preventing higher productivity.Some common barriers to productivity are addressed below.Having a productivity range can be helpful. Provider temperament, preferences, andclinical practice styles vary between all types of providers, including behavioral healthproviders. Granting providers some autonomy in determining their own pace within anaccepted range can help clinicians thrive. The more autonomy an organization providesto employees, the more employees will be apt to affirm autonomy with patients, which isrelated to client engagement and activation.School SchedulesDifferent SBHCs operate on different yearly schedules. Some are tied closely to theschool calendars while others operate independently year-round, much as a communityclinic would do. These decisions are influenced by many factors, and in general: SBHCsthat serve a broader community tend to be open more hours and months; SBHCs thatare in a separate building and/or have an external entrance are more likely to be openmore hours and months; and lead agencies other than school districts are more likelyto be open year-round. Many FQHC run SBHCs operate year-round and are able to seepatients (students and others) even when school is not in session. Some close for thesummer and others have reduced summer hours. A best practice for clinical continuityis to ensure after hours care coordination and offer at least some services during thesummer and other school breaks - if not onsite at the SBHC, then at another local clinic orvia telehealth. SBHC staff and providers may work a 10-month schedule (as with schooldistrict employees), have reduced hours during summer breaks, be redeployed to thelead agency to cover other employee leaves, or be offered paid or unpaid time off.Scheduling TemplatesSchedule templates are an important tool to focus BH clinician time. Session lengths varywithin IBH settings and sites. Organizations may utilize 30-minute, 45-minute and/or thetraditional 50-60 minute sessions, and most allow for a mix of all of these depending onwhether a client is new, their acuity, comfort with mental health, and how frequently they areseen. It is important to remember that the average visit length will impact the productivityrange of clinicians and that the goal of productivity is to be sitting in front of patients, providingservices, for at least 50% of the day for school-based clinicians (and 75% for other clinicsettings).

This means that the opportunity for billable visits exists outside the schoolday and is not limited to school hours. In these instances, behavioral health visits canoften occur outside school hours and on days when school is not in session.For SBHCs more tied to student and school schedules, achieving 4-5 billable visits perday may be more challenging due to the size of the student population, fewer clinichours, and all the interruptions such as testing, bell schedules and other commitments.These clinics also have fewer revenue-generating days a year between professionaldevelopment days, school holidays, breaks and other events.Strategies to Address:• With permission from the school, SBHCs may consider widening the targetpopulation to include graduates, students from other local schools, siblings, oreven community members unaffiliated with the school. This decision shouldbe considered carefully with special attention to the impact on confidentialadolescent services. Some SBHCs have separate entrances and waiting roomsfor community members or differentiated hours for different populations.•●SBHCs can also consider adjusting clinic schedules to ensure that the availabilityof BH services is a good fit with client and prospective client demand.Clinicians who are authentically motivated to offer empathic, culturally resonant care,tracking and improving health outcomes with attention to client experience, and takingan active role in how services are coordinated for students across the school campus, arethe ideal fit for a SBHC setting.Clinicians who don’t take an active role in outreach, engagement and ensuring accesscan influence the sustainability of the behavioral health services. They may create rigidbarriers to higher productivity, maintain low caseloads, or not collaborate fully withother team members.The following are common myths and beliefs of some traditional BH clinicians, whichcan become barriers to a successful integrated SBHC model. Clinicians that hold thesebeliefs closely may be a poor fit for a sustainable IBH practice in the SBHC.Traditional Belief: More time with each patient is associated with better quality services.Alternative Perspective: Especially in an integrated setting, shorter visits and flexibility withhow schedules are managed can be positive drivers for patients and providers alike. Simple,skilled, empathic care moments are associated with shortened time spent in visits. Focusingon clients’ strengths and resilience prevents providers from assuming more time andattention is needed when actually patients might benefit from confidence building that leadsto independent resolution of problems. It’s often the case that children and adolescentsprefer 30-minute visits due to the cadence of their day and their attention span. See page 32in this guide for more information on alternatives to the “50-minute hour”.Key Considerations:We know high volume, fast pace work is correlated to providers burning out, so thesystem culture that includes autonomy and flexibility is key.Traditional Belief: Documentation takes 40-50% of the shift.Alternative Perspective: Documentation standards at FQHCs are purposely designed tobe less cumbersome than those in specialty mental health to allow clinicians to spendmore time addressing the needs of patients. Providers who come from other systems ofcare might bring those practices with them and may be closed off to learning new ways ofthinking about documentation. This may show up as an insistence on a separate informedconsent for BH services, an emphasis on including more information than necessary in thenotes, and/or an assertion that BH notes need to be kept private from the medical record.All of these practices are rooted in a paradigm that is different from an integrated modeland all are associated with a more time-intensive documentation workload.Key Considerations:Integration requires skills-training on how and what to document and how information isshared on interdisciplinary teams.Traditional Belief: The role of the clinician is limited to face-to-face visits.Alternative Perspective: Ideally, clinicians will take a comprehensive approach toapplying several strategies that foster integration:•●Encouraging an open-door, flexible approach to youth, teachers, medical teammembers, and families•●Playing an active role in access solutions by ensuring there is always an opendoor for new visits so youth are never placed on a wait list•●Taking ownership and action when there is a cancellation or missed appointmentand using that time to meet the needs of other youth•●Committing to billable visit targets with an understanding that fiscal sustainabilityis connected to meeting the needs of students•●The addition of telehealth visits, allowing clinicians to reach out by phone tothose who may be waiting for an appointmentKey Considerations:Leadership embodiment that models this and hiring for fit/match is helpful in fosteringthis type of cultural milieu.To sustain an ongoing flow of students, an ongoing referral stream is needed. A lowvolume of referrals may be a result of several factors. Youth may not be aware that theyhave access to behavioral health care, they may hold fear, stigma or other beliefs aboutbehavioral health that contribute to low engagement, clinicians may not be a cultural fitfor the student population, and/or the medical staff and school staff may not understandthe service options or may carry their own perceptions and myths about behavioralhealth that prevent them making appropriate and robust referrals.Strategies to Address:•●School integration is critical to maintaining a steady flow of student referrals.Clinicians and other SBHC staff should attend school staff meetings to explainthe services offered, how school staff can refer students, and the benefits ofbehavioral health services for students. This should happen repeatedly over thecourse of each school year.•●SBHC staff can also attend school staff meetings and professional developmentsessions to be more integrated into the school staff community and be seen aspart of the team.•●Youth Advisory Boards of students can serve as ambassadors and outreachworkers, explaining SBHC services to their peers, and vouching for theconfidentiality and accessibility of services.•●Clinicians should avoid jargon and use language and concepts that areaccessible to youth and families. Diagnostic jargon is especially problematic andcan increase the stigma associated with behavioral health care. For example,the word “stress” is more accessible than “anxiety”. SBHC staff should appeal tostudent and school strengths rather than focusing on pathology concepts.•●Use a variety of outreach modalities. Announcements, presentations, flyers,videos, text blasts and social media presence are all useful ways to connectdirectly with youth or through school communication to students. Special eventsare also great ways to spread the word. Many SBHCs host events like wellnessfairs or host tours during school registration or Back to School Night. Others makeconnections with student groups and Gay-Straight Alliances.•●Share examples. Use storytelling to champion examples of how behavioralhealth care has impacted young people in positive ways. Avoid stories that areoverly focused on the clinician or the type of therapy and instead highlight theaccessible human centered changes in areas that young people care about. (Andalways protect client confidentiality!)•●Actively address systemic racism and cultural mismatch. Name the disconnectif it’s there and try to ensure that staff faces and voices that resonate with youthand families. Use student advisory structures to influence services, hiring, andoutreach materials.•●Encourage “open access” so youth and staff are familiar with coming to see abehavioral health clinician whenever openings pop up.•●Offer regular messaging and workshops that promote human-centeredbehavioral health care so staff are aligned in an open access framework. Oneform of stigma is assuming only certain types of people will need or wanttherapy. Move from that “us and them” thinking to the collective “we”.•●Establish robust automated referrals from screening. Most SBHC use multiplescreening tools at new patient visits and yearly intervals. These likely includePHQ-9 (depression), SBIRT (substance use), Pediatric Symptom Checklist(emotional, behavioral, cognitive difficulties), PEARLS (adverse childhoodexperiences), GAD-7 (anxiety), and others. When referrals to behavioral health arestanding orders for positives on any screening tool and when medical assistantsand other staff are empowered to make these referrals, volume increases andyouth needs are more apt to be met.•●Other outreach strategies might include regular drop-in hours for teachersto consult about youth, drop-in hours for parents to meet BH clinicians, andad-hoc consultations with school staff and the medical team. If behavioralhealth clinicians are completing an average of 4-5 billable visits per day, theseother activities happen throughout the week. Varying the day to day work toinclude outreach and connection to school staff generally supports clinician jobsatisfaction. (Note that it’s important to consider student confidentiality concernswhen scheduling school staff meetings/drop-in hours.)Across care settings, the average missed appointment rate is 30% for behavioral healthvisits - although most clinics are reporting that this rate fell closer to 10% with thewidespread shift to telehealth during the COVID pandemic. It is generally thought thisis related to the ease with which patients access the appointments. It is important toconsider the many barriers that can lead to missed appointments for both in-person andtelehealth appointments. For example, ambivalence is common for many behavioralhealth clients and especially adolescents. Like adults, teens have competing prioritiesincluding peers, classes, tests and other activities. They may become immersed in theseactivities which can take priority over their BH appointment. Some of this ambivalence,distraction or time management can also be addressed directly in therapy.Relying on referrals can be problematic - we want to see every child at the well child visitand every parent after a PEARLS screen, for example. But, this can also be done throughactive outreach to increase referrals.Strategies to Address:•●Many SBHCs are experimenting with text reminders and other electronicmethods for prompting higher show rates.•●One of the unique opportunities of being a school-based clinic is having yourpatient population in the same building or very close by. If a student misses anappointment, an SBHC staff member should be able to call their classroom andask their teacher to remind them of their appointment (or text their phone directlyif they are able to check their phone during class).•●Clinicians may know where to find their patient on campus and can walk to getthem if the student is amenable.•●SBHC staff should be able to “juggle” the schedule to give another student thatslot and reschedule the missed appointment.•●Change language from “no-show” to “schedule opening” or other similarterminology to indicate that this time is to be used for some other serviceprovision.

Because only client-facing non-same day services are eligiblefor reimbursement, most other activities tend to be implicitly undervalued, and yet theseactivities are often central to a positive, sustainable model of care.Strategies to Address:•●Try not to use the term “productivity” only with respect to billable visits as thisimplies that only reimbursed patient care is productive, and this can undercutmeaningful touches like front office staff connections, medical assistantinterventions, time spent coordinating care, team members consulting with oneanother, and training and professional development.• Spend intentional time training the team on roles and responsibilities thatcomplement the fee-for-service structure. In the table below, there are examplesof ways to prioritize visits and distribute tasks among other team members.

This means that the opportunity for billable visits exists outside the schoolday and is not limited to school hours. In these instances, behavioral health visits canoften occur outside school hours and on days when school is not in session.For SBHCs more tied to student and school schedules, achieving 4-5 billable visits perday may be more", "more tied to student and school schedules, achieving 4-5 billable visits perday may be more challenging due to the size of the student population, fewer clinichours, and all the interruptions such as testing, bell schedules and other commitments.These clinics also have fewer revenue-generating days a year between professionaldevelopment days, school holidays, breaks and other events.Strategies to Address:• With permission from the school, SBHCs may consider widening the targetpopulation to include graduates, students from other local schools, siblings, oreven community members unaffiliated with the school. This decision shouldbe considered carefully with special attention to the impact on confidentialadolescent services. Some SBHCs have separate entrances and waiting roomsfor community members or differentiated hours for different populations.•●SBHCs can also consider adjusting clinic schedules to ensure that the availabilityof BH services is a good fit with client and prospective client demand.Clinicians who are authentically motivated to offer empathic, culturally resonant care,tracking and improving health outcomes with attention to client experience, and takingan active role in how services are coordinated for students across the school campus, arethe ideal fit for a SBHC setting.Clinicians who don’t take an active role in outreach, engagement and ensuring accesscan influence the sustainability of the behavioral health services. They may create rigidbarriers to higher productivity, maintain low caseloads, or not collaborate fully withother team members.The following are common myths and beliefs of some traditional BH clinicians, whichcan become barriers to a successful integrated SBHC model. Clinicians that hold thesebeliefs closely may be a poor fit for a sustainable IBH practice in the SBHC.Traditional Belief: More time with each patient is associated with better quality services.Alternative Perspective: Especially in an integrated setting, shorter visits and flexibility withhow schedules are managed can be positive drivers for patients and providers alike. Simple,skilled, empathic care moments are associated with shortened time spent in visits. Focusingon clients’ strengths and resilience prevents providers from assuming more time andattention is needed when actually patients might benefit from confidence building that leadsto independent resolution of problems. It’s often the case that children and adolescentsprefer 30-minute visits due to the cadence of their day and their attention span. See page 32in this guide for more information on alternatives to the “50-minute hour”.Key Considerations:We know high volume, fast pace work is correlated to providers burning out, so thesystem culture that includes autonomy and flexibility is key.Traditional Belief: Documentation takes 40-50% of the shift.Alternative Perspective: Documentation standards at FQHCs are purposely", "key.Traditional Belief: Documentation takes 40-50% of the shift.Alternative Perspective: Documentation standards at FQHCs are purposely designed tobe less cumbersome than those in specialty mental health to allow clinicians to spendmore time addressing the needs of patients. Providers who come from other systems ofcare might bring those practices with them and may be closed off to learning new ways ofthinking about documentation. This may show up as an insistence on a separate informedconsent for BH services, an emphasis on including more information than necessary in thenotes, and/or an assertion that BH notes need to be kept private from the medical record.All of these practices are rooted in a paradigm that is different from an integrated modeland all are associated with a more time-intensive documentation workload.Key Considerations:Integration requires skills-training on how and what to document and how information isshared on interdisciplinary teams.Traditional Belief: The role of the clinician is limited to face-to-face visits.Alternative Perspective: Ideally, clinicians will take a comprehensive approach toapplying several strategies that foster integration:•●Encouraging an open-door, flexible approach to youth, teachers, medical teammembers, and families•●Playing an active role in access solutions by ensuring there is always an opendoor for new visits so youth are never placed on a wait list•●Taking ownership and action when there is a cancellation or missed appointmentand using that time to meet the needs of other youth•●Committing to billable visit targets with an understanding that fiscal sustainabilityis connected to meeting the needs of students•●The addition of telehealth visits, allowing clinicians to reach out by phone tothose who may be waiting for an appointmentKey Considerations:Leadership embodiment that models this and hiring for fit/match is helpful in fosteringthis type of cultural milieu.To sustain an ongoing flow of students, an ongoing referral stream is needed. A lowvolume of referrals may be a result of several factors. Youth may not be aware that theyhave access to behavioral health care, they may hold fear, stigma or other beliefs aboutbehavioral health that contribute to low engagement, clinicians may not be a cultural fitfor the student population, and/or the medical staff and school staff may not understandthe service options or may carry their own perceptions and myths about behavioralhealth that prevent them making appropriate and robust referrals.Strategies to Address:•●School integration is critical to maintaining a steady flow of student referrals.Clinicians and other SBHC staff should attend school staff meetings to explainthe services offered, how school staff can refer students, and the benefits", "staff meetings to explainthe services offered, how school staff can refer students, and the benefits ofbehavioral health services for students. This should happen repeatedly over thecourse of each school year.•●SBHC staff can also attend school staff meetings and professional developmentsessions to be more integrated into the school staff community and be seen aspart of the team.•●Youth Advisory Boards of students can serve as ambassadors and outreachworkers, explaining SBHC services to their peers, and vouching for theconfidentiality and accessibility of services.•●Clinicians should avoid jargon and use language and concepts that areaccessible to youth and families. Diagnostic jargon is especially problematic andcan increase the stigma associated with behavioral health care. For example,the word “stress” is more accessible than “anxiety”. SBHC staff should appeal tostudent and school strengths rather than focusing on pathology concepts.•●Use a variety of outreach modalities. Announcements, presentations, flyers,videos, text blasts and social media presence are all useful ways to connectdirectly with youth or through school communication to students. Special eventsare also great ways to spread the word. Many SBHCs host events like wellnessfairs or host tours during school registration or Back to School Night. Others makeconnections with student groups and Gay-Straight Alliances.•●Share examples. Use storytelling to champion examples of how behavioralhealth care has impacted young people in positive ways. Avoid stories that areoverly focused on the clinician or the type of therapy and instead highlight theaccessible human centered changes in areas that young people care about. (Andalways protect client confidentiality!)•●Actively address systemic racism and cultural mismatch. Name the disconnectif it’s there and try to ensure that staff faces and voices that resonate with youthand families. Use student advisory structures to influence services, hiring, andoutreach materials.•●Encourage “open access” so youth and staff are familiar with coming to see abehavioral health clinician whenever openings pop up.•●Offer regular messaging and workshops that promote human-centeredbehavioral health care so staff are aligned in an open access framework. Oneform of stigma is assuming only certain types of people will need or wanttherapy. Move from that “us and them” thinking to the collective “we”.•●Establish robust automated referrals from screening. Most SBHC use multiplescreening tools at new patient visits and yearly intervals. These likely includePHQ-9 (depression), SBIRT (substance use), Pediatric Symptom Checklist(emotional, behavioral, cognitive difficulties), PEARLS (adverse childhoodexperiences), GAD-7 (anxiety), and others. When referrals to behavioral health arestanding orders for positives on any screening tool and when medical assistantsand other staff are empowered to make these referrals,", "any screening tool and when medical assistantsand other staff are empowered to make these referrals, volume increases andyouth needs are more apt to be met.•●Other outreach strategies might include regular drop-in hours for teachersto consult about youth, drop-in hours for parents to meet BH clinicians, andad-hoc consultations with school staff and the medical team. If behavioralhealth clinicians are completing an average of 4-5 billable visits per day, theseother activities happen throughout the week. Varying the day to day work toinclude outreach and connection to school staff generally supports clinician jobsatisfaction. (Note that it’s important to consider student confidentiality concernswhen scheduling school staff meetings/drop-in hours.)Across care settings, the average missed appointment rate is 30% for behavioral healthvisits - although most clinics are reporting that this rate fell closer to 10% with thewidespread shift to telehealth during the COVID pandemic. It is generally thought thisis related to the ease with which patients access the appointments. It is important toconsider the many barriers that can lead to missed appointments for both in-person andtelehealth appointments. For example, ambivalence is common for many behavioralhealth clients and especially adolescents. Like adults, teens have competing prioritiesincluding peers, classes, tests and other activities. They may become immersed in theseactivities which can take priority over their BH appointment. Some of this ambivalence,distraction or time management can also be addressed directly in therapy.Relying on referrals can be problematic - we want to see every child at the well child visitand every parent after a PEARLS screen, for example. But, this can also be done throughactive outreach to increase referrals.Strategies to Address:•●Many SBHCs are experimenting with text reminders and other electronicmethods for prompting higher show rates.•●One of the unique opportunities of being a school-based clinic is having yourpatient population in the same building or very close by. If a student misses anappointment, an SBHC staff member should be able to call their classroom andask their teacher to remind them of their appointment (or text their phone directlyif they are able to check their phone during class).•●Clinicians may know where to find their patient on campus and can walk to getthem if the student is amenable.•●SBHC staff should be able to “juggle” the schedule to give another student thatslot and reschedule the missed appointment.•●Change language from “no-show” to “schedule opening” or other similarterminology to indicate that this time is to be used for some other serviceprovision. This re-framing encourages clinicians to be", "time is to be used for some other serviceprovision. This re-framing encourages clinicians to be proactive in how they mightuse that time.•●Use a weekly rather than daily time tracking ratio to encourage more autonomyand increase the likelihood of successfully meeting visit targets.

Therapists saidthat the telehealth format actually enhanced treatment for 50% of the families.How This Can Increase Revenue:Only one PPS payment is allowed for group visits that include multiple Medi-Calbeneficiaries. BH clinicians can select one person from the group to submit a billingclaim for. Scheduling brief checks-in before or after the group with different clients isoften clinically warranted, and any visit lasting at least 16 minutes can be submitted forpayment as an individual visit. This might include preparing a new member for the group,checking in with a patient who shared something significant after the group, and canhelp extend the benefit and revenue from groups. These check-ins need to include briefassessments on mood and functioning as well as evidence-based interventions to bebillable. If this strategy is implemented, each group can generate several more billablevisits in an efficient and powerful use of clinician time.Why this is Good Clinical Practice:Group therapy has been found to be as effective as individual therapy and in some cases,the peer connection can increase engagement and retention in treatment. Because peersare so critical to adolescent social and self development, group therapy can be especiallyeffective with teens and young adults. It also exerts a normalizing influence on students’view of mental health services generally. Offering groups can be a rewarding practicefor clinicians facing burnout with high individual caseloads. SBHC support staff can helporganize and coordinate groups to share responsibilities and foster greater teamwork.How This Can Increase Revenue:In December 2019, California approved a $29 incentive payment for all ACEs and PEARLSscreening completed.34 For those under 18, the recommendation is to screen using thePEARLS yearly. Providers can be paid for one per client per year, and screening is oftenconducted during primary care visits. This represents a new, additional payment thatcan go toward sustaining behavioral health services. If an SBHC screens every child andadolescent in the practice every year, even small clinics can generate over $10,000 a year.If 300 youth are screened with PEARLs in one year, usually during wellness exams,$10,000 in revenue would be generated.More information can be found on the ACEs Aware website: https://www.acesaware.org/and the APL can be found in Appendix F.Why This is Good Clinical Practice:Screening early and often for adverse childhood experiences is associated with betterhealth outcomes later in life. Without screening, behavioral health clinicians may misstrauma histories, ongoing micro-traumas, and signs and symptoms may go undetected.This can also cause clinicians to treat disorders without understanding their etiology orsource. We know that trauma is not only associated with social, emotional and cognitiveproblems, it is also associated with many negative physical health difficulties. Addressingtrauma early allows adults to help youth increase their resilience and protective factors.How this Can Increase Revenue:Family therapy is now a reimbursable Medi-Cal service, even when the identified childdoes not meet a mental health diagnosis. See this Family Therapy Benefit Information formore information. This benefit allows BH clinicians wider freedom in engaging families forprevention and early intervention services. For example:•●BH clinicians can call families during down time or during missed appointments;virtually any skillful “check-in” that elicits family input and providespsychoeducation is billable.•●BH clinicians can see children and youth alone, then see a child and parent,caregiver or other family member together, and bill two separate sessions if thisis clinically appropriate.Why this is Good Clinical Practice:Involving family in the treatment of youth is key to understanding many dynamicsproblems comprehensively and is also key to supporting and sustaining improvementsand change. If the child or adolescent receives therapy to address their struggles,but those struggles are exacerbated at home, the likelihood that they will be able tobenefit from therapy is reduced. Additionally, the health and well-being of families isfoundational to healthy communities.There are times when involving family is not indicated. If the well-being of the youth is notsupported, they are at least 12 years old, and able to engage in treatment independently,the treatment plan can include privilege with confidentiality being held between thestudent and the clinician.Basics:- 26-minute minimum time- CPT code: 90846 for family therapy without patient present- CPT code: 90847 for family therapy with patient present- ONLY LCSW can bill at PPS rate; no exceptions for ASW during public health emergency- Children under the age of 21- 5 sessions allowable without any risk factors present use: ICD 10 code F99- More than 5 sessions with documented risk factors use: ICD 10 code Z65.9Risk factors for the child include:- Separation from a parent/guardian due to incarceration or immigration- Death of a parent/guardian- Foster home placement- Food insecurity, housing instability- Exposure to domestic violence or traumatic events- Maltreatment- Severe or persistent bullying- Experience of discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation,religion, learning differences or- DisabilityOR child has a parent/guardian with one of the risk factors below:- Serious illness or disability- History of incarceration- Depression or other mood disorder- PTSD or other anxiety disorder- Psychotic disorder under treatment- Substance use disorder- History of intimate partner or interpersonal violence-Is a teen parentSome examples of evidence-based family therapy are:- Child-Parent Psychotherapy (ages 0 thru 5)- Triple P Positive Parenting Program (ages 0 thru 16)- Parent Child Interactive Therapy (ages 2 thru 12)", "chunks": ["How This Can Increase Revenue:California’s recent approval of reimbursement for phone and video behavioral healthservices provides an important new pathway to achieve financial sustainability forbehavioral health services.

If an SBHC screens every child andadolescent in the practice every year, even small clinics can generate over $10,000 a year.If 300 youth are screened with PEARLs in one year, usually during wellness exams,$10,000 in revenue would be generated.More information can be found on the ACEs Aware website: https://www.acesaware.org/and the APL can be found in Appendix F.Why This is Good Clinical Practice:Screening early and often for adverse childhood experiences is associated with betterhealth outcomes later in life. Without screening, behavioral health clinicians may misstrauma histories, ongoing micro-traumas, and signs and symptoms may go undetected.This can also cause clinicians to treat disorders without understanding their etiology orsource. We know that trauma is not only associated with social, emotional and cognitiveproblems, it is also associated with many negative physical health difficulties. Addressingtrauma early allows adults to help youth increase their resilience and protective factors.How this Can Increase Revenue:Family therapy is now a reimbursable Medi-Cal service, even when the identified childdoes not meet a mental health diagnosis. See this Family Therapy Benefit Information formore information. This benefit allows BH clinicians wider freedom in engaging families forprevention and early intervention services. For example:•●BH clinicians can call families during down time or during missed appointments;virtually any skillful “check-in” that elicits family input and providespsychoeducation is billable.•●BH clinicians can see children and youth alone, then see a child and parent,caregiver or other family member together, and bill two separate sessions if thisis clinically appropriate.Why this is Good Clinical Practice:Involving family in the treatment of youth is key to understanding many dynamicsproblems comprehensively and is also key to supporting and sustaining improvementsand change. If the child or adolescent receives therapy to address their struggles,but those struggles are exacerbated at home, the likelihood that they will be able tobenefit from therapy is reduced. Additionally, the health and well-being of families isfoundational to healthy communities.There are times when involving family is not indicated.

These range from mission-focused values to smart business practice. We outline a few key ones below. Research and experience demonstrate that SBHCs have a positive impact on health and education outcomes and equity. They increase attendance, and in a recent study of SBHCs in Los Angeles Unified School District, this pattern is most pronounced among students who use mental health services at their SBHC. SBHCs can also increase students’ connectedness to caring adults and their school, which is a protective factor against multiple health and education risks. Utilizing SBHCs reduces high-risk behaviors, especially among marginalized populations such as LGBTQ+ youth and young men of color. SBHCs increase the use of cost-effective preventive care such as immunizations, family planning, well-child visits, and behavioral health care. Children and youth covered by Medi-Cal – especially those over age 5 – receive less than half of the preventive services recommended by pediatricians, and therefore important opportunities for identifying trauma, developmental delays, and a range of chronic health conditions are missed. Adolescents, and especially low-income adolescents of color, are not always well served by the existing health care system but benefit from many health care touchpoints given the rapid physical, socio-emotional, behavioral, and developmental changes that occur during this time period. By providing care in a familiar, trusted location, like a school-based health center, young people receive more screening, prevention, and earlier intervention for concerns that, if left untreated, may have lasting consequences. In fact, most care in SBHCs is focused on prevention and wellness, which involves ample time for screening, counseling, and anticipatory guidance. This is especially important given recent increases in the incidence of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, suicide, overdose, obesity, and sexually-transmitted infections. SBHCs also decrease utilization of emergency room services for students with asthma and other chronic conditions. Related to the above, SBHCs can help health care agencies improve clinical quality scores in areas like well-child visits, immunizations, chlamydia screening, depression screening and follow-up, and asthma control. This can help with pay-per-performance and value-based care, accreditation, primary care health home status, and reporting for HEDIS, UDS, and other measures. SBHCs increase health equity. Access to culturally competent, high-quality, first-contact primary care through SBHCs is an effective, research-based strategy to reduce health inequities and improve health outcomes for LGBTQ+ youth, low-income youth, and youth of color. SBHCs assure equal opportunities for all children to access needed health care services. SBHCs focus on health care services for children and youth with Medi-Cal coverage. SBHCs leverage the fact that fewer children than adults are uninsured and almost half are covered by Medi-Cal. Youth in California have access to the program regardless of documentation status and with higher family-income thresholds than adults. More generally, SBHCs help increase a lead agency’s base of patients/clients. They provide outreach to a wide cross-section of the community and a way to generate a steady flow of young people and families that need medical, dental and behavioral health care without a costly or complex marketing campaign. As community health centers have struggled to retain patient numbers in the face of widespread gentrification in many California cities, SBHCs can also serve broader communities in need. Satisfied SBHC patients can become promoters of lead agencies for their friends and families well past graduation. SBHCs offer lead agencies deeper connections to the communities they serve and positive visibility with a range of stakeholders. They are a health care model built on authentically listening to and engaging with the target population. The impact of this model has gained attention of funders at the federal level, as evidenced by several recent rounds of grants from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) focused exclusively on SBHCs. SBHCs allow health care providers to more easily collaborate with the other important players that impact child health and development. In traditional health settings it is difficult for a pediatrician to participate in a special education meeting, or for a psychologist to have easy access to a student’s teachers. Most primary care providers can’t easily coordinate with school nurses around daily medications or blood sugar levels. SBHCs promote this integration and support much smoother coordination of care, ultimately improving health and education outcomes. SBHCs support workforce development. Many health care providers and other staff welcome the opportunity to work in this novel setting delivering relationship-based “upstream” preventive care to young people. This can help with workforce recruitment and retention at a time when this has never been more challenging. In addition, SBHCs mentor young people to enter health careers, helping build a diverse health care pipeline that better reflects California demographics and promotes graduation/career pathways. The current policy environment is very supportive of the development, expansion and improvement of SBHCs. A variety of current state initiatives recognize the importance of child and adolescent trauma, behavioral health care, collaboration between health and social services, and community school partnerships. Although California continues to be one of the few large states that does not directly fund SBHCs, the broader conditions in the Golden State are generally favorable. For example, most low-income children and youth now qualify for Medi-Cal; Family PACT covers family planning services for most adolescents; and multiple state initiatives support adolescent and school mental health services.

Most primary care providers can’t easily coordinate with school nurses around daily medications or blood sugar levels. SBHCs promote this integration and support much smoother coordination of care, ultimately improving health and education outcomes. SBHCs support workforce development. Many health care providers and other staff welcome the opportunity to work in this novel setting delivering relationship-based “upstream” preventive care to young people. This can help with workforce recruitment and retention at a time when this has never been more challenging. In addition, SBHCs mentor young people to enter health careers, helping build a diverse health care pipeline that better reflects California", "to enter health careers, helping build a diverse health care pipeline that better reflects California demographics and promotes graduation/career pathways. The current policy environment is very supportive of the development, expansion and improvement of SBHCs. A variety of current state initiatives recognize the importance of child and adolescent trauma, behavioral health care, collaboration between health and social services, and community school partnerships. Although California continues to be one of the few large states that does not directly fund SBHCs, the broader conditions in the Golden State are generally favorable. For example, most low-income children and youth now qualify for Medi-Cal; Family PACT covers family planning services for most adolescents; and multiple state initiatives support adolescent and school mental health services.

Most SBHCs are physically small (1-3 exam rooms) and have less than one full-time medical practitioner working in them. (This ranges from 0.2 FTE to 2.0 or more medical providers.) The service mix varies. For example, in a typical community health center, there might be one behavioral health clinician for every four medical providers, whereas SBHCs might have more behavioral health than primary care FTE. In general, school communities find that it is beneficial to maximize behavioral health services availability, and maintain at least a 1:1 ratio of behavioral health to medical provider time. While the medical needs of a population of 1,000+ adolescents can usually be addressed by a 1.0 FTE nurse practitioner or physician assistant, behavioral health needs are much more time-intensive. It is also recommended to have a high ratio of health education staff given the many opportunities for health promotion, counseling, teaching, and motivational interviewing. SBHCs address many social determinants of health and education. Going back to their origins, SBHCs have always supported young people in ways that were holistic, not strictly clinical, acknowledging the ways that factors like hunger, school failure, and dating violence impacted student health and well-being. SBHCs operate peer health education programs, conduct classroom education, and connect students to employment services and youth development programs in their communities that support social connection. Some SBHCs host school supply giveaways and food distribution, many operate peer mentorship or peer health education programs, others host medical legal partnerships, and still others offer groups for new immigrants, young men of color, and/or girls' empowerment. Because of both proximity and collaboration with school, students often walk into their school-based health centers seeking support they might be reluctant to request from a community-based medical center or mental health program. SBHC staff accept this challenge and go “outside the clinic walls” to support adolescent autonomy, health, and well-being. SBHCs also help promote developmental assets (positive supports and strengths that young people need to succeed) such as a caring school environment, positive adult relationships, and demonstrating that the community values youth. Staffing needs vary. Because SBHCs are small, their staff care teams are often less specialized than those working in larger health centers. For example, larger community-based clinics may employ medical records personnel, referrals staff, a call center, and/or billers, not to mention dedicated nurse case managers that support a number of primary care providers. SBHCs are more likely to have a few staff who play multiple roles – e.g., a medical assistant that also handles referrals and medical records, and a receptionist/clerk who does billing and insurance enrollment. There are more collaborative relationships to navigate. At a minimum, SBHC operators – assuming they are not run by the school district itself – will need to work in close collaboration with the host school and school district. Schools often have many other service providers on campus, so those entities are also important partners – this includes after-school programs, Family Resource Centers, and other mental health providers working with special populations. (See more on coordinating services below.) In part because of the relationships described above, SBHCs typically require a higher ratio of management to provider FTE than other centers. SBHCs lack the assembly line efficiencies or economies of scale, are intrinsically complex, and benefit from an administrator who is very skilled at nurturing trusted relationships for the school and parent community. Parents and guardians are often not present for their children’s care. The beauty of the model is that caregivers can authorize consent at the beginning of a school year or enrollment and then children can independently access the care for which consent was provided. This means less transportation burdens and interference with work for families and caregivers. This facilitates easy access but can also complicate some aspects of the care. For example, children and youth often cannot give a thorough medical history; discussions about vaccines, specialty referrals and other decisions or follow-up take coordination with parents/caregivers through collateral visits by phone, video and sometimes in person. Lack of a clearly defined model. Unlike some other provider types (such as FQHCs, free clinics, and/or tribal clinics), there are no statutes in California governing SBHCs. SBHCs therefore follow various licensing and regulatory rules depending on their lead agency and other factors such as how many hours per week they operate. Unlike other states, SBHCs are not required to submit any consistent data that is centered on the model or the needs of children and youth. Site visits to ensure quality are not consistently performed and therefore there is abundant variation and diversity across sites. In addition, related concepts like “school wellness center” (see text box at right) can introduce more complexity and variation, and sometimes centers that appear to be SBHCs are opened with non-SBHC names. It is difficult in this context to promote clarity and understanding about SBHCs in California. The term “wellness center” has become popular in recent years but is used inconsistently across California. Most often it is used to refer to a center run by an LEA (local educational agency) with a primary focus on behavioral health and no onsite physical health services. It’s hard to control an SBHC’s payer mix. The SBHC model works best with an open door policy that allows all students to access services. This is in contrast to other settings that are often focused on patients with a particular health insurance/payer – e.g., a closed system like Kaiser Permanente or clinics that have members assigned by Medi-Cal managed care plans. While this approach is a deliberate way to encourage children and teens to utilize the primary and preventive care services, it can mean there are many services provided without a payer source – e.g., when a student with Kaiser coverage chooses to use their SBHC for a comprehensive sports physical. (One promising future development will be the state’s development of a Statewide School-linked Fee Schedule for all payers, due to be implemented by 2024.) Limited hours of operation. For budgetary reasons and because client volume is limited by the school size, some SBHCs operate for as little as one day each week. Many are closed during school breaks and summers, making arrangements for continuity of care via their lead agency or other community partners. Less predictable operating schedules. School environments are quite different from health care settings. SBHC operations are interrupted by events like assemblies, fire drills, exams and state testing, school lockdowns, pep rallies, field trips, and professional development days. These disruptions are common and can disable the SBHC for hours or days at a time. With a small number of providers, an entire clinic shift can be impacted by the nurse practitioner responding to a medical emergency on the football field or in the classroom, or the social worker coordinating a 5150 psychiatric hold and consult. At La Clínica de La Raza, a large FQHC based in Oakland that operates 8 SBHCs, productivity standards are approached differently than in other primary care clinics. Providers working at La Clínica’s non-SBHC sites are given 20% follow-up time to complete charting, coordination of care, quality improvement, and other patient care related duties. SBHC providers are expected to include their follow-up time in their regular shift s but see fewer patients in each scheduled hour. This pace, and the frequency of no-shows and unexpected interruptions, amounts to a similar overall number of patients per FTE per year as FQHC national standards: 2,100 for non-physician practitioners (NP, PA and CNM) and 4,200 for physicians. Standard measures of provider productivity are likely to be lower than in other settings. Most outpatient health practices operate based on underlying principles of how many clients/patients can be seen throughout a clinical shift in order to balance operating revenue, access, and clinical quality. These standards should be based on reasonable expectations that allow good relationship-building, respect, and clinical quality, even if hurried clinicians sometimes feel otherwise. However, standards set for good outpatient practices do not always translate well to SBHCs because of: (1) a less predictable operating environment (see above); (2) constant turnover of patient population; (3) caregivers not present (see above); and (4) most care focused on prevention and wellness, which involves ample screening, counseling, anticipatory guidance, and conversation, with very few procedures or “expedited” visits. SBHC providers may need to spend relatively more of their total work time building trust and relationships, not just with student clients but also with families and school staff. While no formal standards exist at a state or national level, CSHA suggests the following based on best practices collected from SBHCs over the years: medical providers can see about 2 patients per hour at most in an SBHC setting behavioral health clinicians can see an average of 4-6 clients per day dental providers/teams can see 15-18 patients per day As a result of many of the factors described above – low productivity, frequent closures, more management time, and few economies of scale - health insurance reimbursement alone is often insufficient to cover the full costs of providing high-quality SBHC care. In addition, most SBHCs do not charge patients/families for non-reimbursable care. And in general, staff spend a higher proportion of their time in non-reimbursable activities such as group education, outreach, crisis management, etc. Incomplete local control. SBHCs are “guests” on a school campus, which means lead agencies are subject to at least some of the school’s policies and procedures. This means staff need to be respectful of school rules like hall passes, visitor policies, and being intentional about how and when to pull students from class. Many SBHCs wanted to keep their doors open during the early months of the COVID pandemic, but had to follow district closures. Venice Family Clinic, which operates three SBHCs in the Los Angeles area, has found that doing facilities work such as implementing a data network for EHR access has been challenging. Lead agencies need to know who owns the equipment at the SBHC, where to go for repairs, and know that the timeline for making these kinds of changes might be very different than what they expect. This is often learned when planning and constructing a new SBHC where multiple players can slow the process significantly. There can be controversies. In California, there are laws to support a young person accessing confidential and/or sensitive services, known as California Minor Consent and Confidentiality Laws. Even with this law, concerns may surface about children and teens independently accessing health care services – especially ones like family planning, mental health, or even immunizations. Schools and the education sector have different rules about information-sharing than health care providers. Schools are governed by a federal law called FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) that differs quite significantly from HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and other health care laws. In California, minors are legally permitted to access a variety of health care services during the school day without parent/guardian consent; however, schools are responsible for what happens to students on the school campus and are accustomed to knowing everything about what happens to students while there. Accustomed to operating with full information about students, administrators can become frustrated when they are not informed of things like mental health emergencies, child abuse reports, pregnancies, and/or students using substances on campus. These issues can be challenging in any setting serving adolescents but can be particularly thorny in SBHCs. The next section includes suggestions for how to increase clarity, partnership and collaboration to address these very challenges.", "chunks": ["This section addresses some of the many ways SBHCs differ from other pediatric and teen health care settings: SBHCs are smaller than typical community-based health centers.

Budget realistically and appropriately. This includes setting realistic productivity standards that may differ from other sites operated by the lead agency; building in non-productive time for outreach, coordination, shorter school days, and more frequent service interruptions. In the absence of good historical data, consider reducing by at least 20-30% the service volume you would expect in a different setting. There also may be good reasons to evaluate an SBHC’s budget and financials without allocating the lead agency’s full indirect overhead. This can be especially true when the lead agency is a hospital or academic medical center with research, teaching, and training costs, as well as ancillary departments less frequently used by SBHCs (e.g., radiology, pharmacy, etc.). Secure some base funding that is not reliant on third party reimbursement. Unfortunately, California does not yet have state grants for SBHCs, but other SBHCs have gained this contribution and commitment from a variety of sources that include: county allocations, Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) grants, private donors, foundation grants, fundraising events, and/or in-kind support from their lead agencies. The Alameda County Health Care Services Agency provides base funding of $110,000 per year to 28 SBHCs. This funding is sourced through Tobacco Master Settlement Fund and local sales tax revenue. Venice Family Clinic provides base funding to its SBHCs through private donations, fundraising and school district contributions. Negotiate a clear MOU that specifies roles and responsibilities. CSHA recommends that all SBHCs have Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) or other documentation with their school hosts and any other close partners (e.g., other agencies with which you will share space), and Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) as needed with agencies that will be sharing patient health information. The MOU should specify roles, responsibilities, data governance/data sharing expectations, and scope of services, as well as any financial agreements. If possible, lead agencies should protect their ability to provide all care within the normal scope of their agency and clinical licensure – for example, not allowing the school or district to impose restrictions on family planning, behavioral health or substance use counseling. Hire for success. Beyond any technical or licensure requirements, providers and other care team members should love children and youth, understand the unique SBHC model, and thrive when working flexibly in a small, low-resource environment under a range of circumstances. Staff continuity is important for building trust with the school community, so rotating staff through the SBHC is not recommended. Students need to feel comfortable with the front desk, medical assistant, providers, and others. Employers also need to be very explicit about schedules and other arrangements: e.g., if the SBHC is closed for the summer, what happens to employees? Are they guaranteed employment at another location? Are they expected to take paid time off? Are they 10- or 11-month employees and if so what happens to their health insurance coverage and other benefits? Finally, management staff need to be emotionally intelligent and skilled at negotiating effectively with school administrators, families, and other partners. Some of the most effective SBHCs in California are led by experienced, seasoned professionals that blend advocacy and assertiveness with lived experience and cultural humility; others are newer to the field and exhibit all these essential skills! All are comfortable going outside established protocols, deferring and consulting when needed, being self-reflective, managing through crisis and change, and never losing sight of their mission or why they are there. Establish strong relationships with key players on the school campus. Ideally, SBHC staff will meet regularly with the school principal or other key administrators. If this is not possible, which is common, they should find ways to share general information about the health center and be a visible presence at most school events and integrated into school culture, including staff meetings, back-to-school night, family orientation, fairs, and PTSA meetings. Be sure to communicate SBHC closures outside of school closures, and try to determine what is most valuable to the school about the SBHC, highlighting these services - whether back-to-school physicals, vaccines, crisis intervention, or periodic consultations for school staff. Keep communication as open and simple as possible, and submit reports at least a few times each year to let school stakeholders know how many students are using the services and other key metrics or stories. Staff should share what they can with school partners – e.g., let them know an emergency vehicle is coming, but not why or for whom. Any new SBHC planning should involve, at minimum, school nurse(s) from the site or district level, and ideally ongoing collaboration with nursing staff. Be aware and sensitive to the fact that some school staff may be less welcoming of the clinic presence, fearing they may lose their unique role or connection to students. It is always advisable to find influential allies such as vice principals, counselors, coaches, teachers, nurses, and/or Community Schools Managers. Also, remember that school staff turnover can be high and that introductions, overviews and tours are needed every school year, even if the SBHC has been on campus for decades! Beyond this general collaboration, the SBHC should be integrated within the web of on-campus service providers and participate in Coordination of Service Team (COST) meetings or the equivalent. SBHC staff should be regular members of COST, there should be clear referral pathways and processes for students who might benefit from SBHC services, and service providers should share information based on clear parameters and agreements shaped by their professional laws and regulations. More information about the COST process can be found here: Coordination of Services Team. One SBHC provided an annual School Staff Recognition Day with lunch and other goodies. Several provide TB tests for teachers on campus so they don’t have to visit their providers, and one SBHC in East Oakland operates a wellness room focused on wellness and support for school staff as well as students. These touches can make a big difference! Educate school personnel. SBHC leadership should be proactive in sharing the SBHC mission, services and other key facts with school leadership and families both to improve SBHC efficiency and to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings and controversies. They should also listen to those same stakeholders to understand their concerns. Some examples: (1) Ensure secondary school staff understand that minors 12 and over (and in some cases even younger) can consent to some of their own health care such as family planning and mental health services. Let stakeholders know that SBHCs follow the same minor consent and confidentiality rules applicable in any other health care settings such as a community pediatrician. Armed with this information they can help respond to caregivers with questions or concerns. This video offers some helpful examples of how schools and SBHCs can better work together within their mutual laws and regulations. (2) School staff should understand the scope of services, since some misinformed voices have spread rumors that SBHCs provide abortion services or gender reassignment surgery. (They do not.) (3) SBHC providers can be inundated with non-revenue generating tasks such as basic first aid or consultations with teachers. Although some of these activities are valuable, it may help to educate school and district personnel up front about providers’ scope of practice and the SBHC revenue model so they become your partners and use your team to the highest level. Collaborating with front office staff, school nurses, and administrators - as well as classroom teachers - can really make a difference for maximizing the skills of all those involved.", "chunks": ["Although not exhaustive, this section offers a few suggestions for how SBHC staff and lead agencies can be most successful operating in this unique environment so that expectations are clear and aligned for all parties.

The MOU should specify roles, responsibilities, data governance/data sharing expectations, and scope of services, as well as any financial agreements. If possible, lead agencies should protect their ability to provide all care within the normal scope of their agency and clinical licensure – for example, not allowing the school or district to impose restrictions on family planning, behavioral health or substance use counseling. Hire for success. Beyond any technical or licensure requirements, providers and other care team members should love children and youth, understand the unique", "requirements, providers and other care team members should love children and youth, understand the unique SBHC model, and thrive when working flexibly in a small, low-resource environment under a range of circumstances. Staff continuity is important for building trust with the school community, so rotating staff through the SBHC is not recommended. Students need to feel comfortable with the front desk, medical assistant, providers, and others. Employers also need to be very explicit about schedules and other arrangements: e.g., if the SBHC is closed for the summer, what happens to employees? Are they guaranteed employment at another location? Are they expected to take paid time off? Are they 10- or 11-month employees and if so what happens to their health insurance coverage and other benefits? Finally, management staff need to be emotionally intelligent and skilled at negotiating effectively with school administrators, families, and other partners. Some of the most effective SBHCs in California are led by experienced, seasoned professionals that blend advocacy and assertiveness with lived experience and cultural humility; others are newer to the field and exhibit all these essential skills! All are comfortable going outside established protocols, deferring and consulting when needed, being self-reflective, managing through crisis and change, and never losing sight of their mission or why they are there. Establish strong relationships with key players on the school campus. Ideally, SBHC staff will meet regularly with the school principal or other key administrators. If this is not possible, which is common, they should find ways to share general information about the health center and be a visible presence at most school events and integrated into school culture, including staff meetings, back-to-school night, family orientation, fairs, and PTSA meetings. Be sure to communicate SBHC closures outside of school closures, and try to determine what is most valuable to the school about the SBHC, highlighting these services - whether back-to-school physicals, vaccines, crisis intervention, or periodic consultations for school staff. Keep communication as open and simple as possible, and submit reports at least a few times each year to let school stakeholders know how many students are using the services and other key metrics or stories. Staff should share what they can with school partners – e.g., let them know an emergency vehicle is coming, but not why or for whom. Any new SBHC planning should involve, at minimum, school nurse(s) from the site or district level, and", "SBHC planning should involve, at minimum, school nurse(s) from the site or district level, and ideally ongoing collaboration with nursing staff. Be aware and sensitive to the fact that some school staff may be less welcoming of the clinic presence, fearing they may lose their unique role or connection to students. It is always advisable to find influential allies such as vice principals, counselors, coaches, teachers, nurses, and/or Community Schools Managers. Also, remember that school staff turnover can be high and that introductions, overviews and tours are needed every school year, even if the SBHC has been on campus for decades! Beyond this general collaboration, the SBHC should be integrated within the web of on-campus service providers and participate in Coordination of Service Team (COST) meetings or the equivalent. SBHC staff should be regular members of COST, there should be clear referral pathways and processes for students who might benefit from SBHC services, and service providers should share information based on clear parameters and agreements shaped by their professional laws and regulations. More information about the COST process can be found here: Coordination of Services Team. One SBHC provided an annual School Staff Recognition Day with lunch and other goodies. Several provide TB tests for teachers on campus so they don’t have to visit their providers, and one SBHC in East Oakland operates a wellness room focused on wellness and support for school staff as well as students. These touches can make a big difference! Educate school personnel. SBHC leadership should be proactive in sharing the SBHC mission, services and other key facts with school leadership and families both to improve SBHC efficiency and to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings and controversies. They should also listen to those same stakeholders to understand their concerns. Some examples: (1) Ensure secondary school staff understand that minors 12 and over (and in some cases even younger) can consent to some of their own health care such as family planning and mental health services. Let stakeholders know that SBHCs follow the same minor consent and confidentiality rules applicable in any other health care settings such as a community pediatrician. Armed with this information they can help respond to caregivers with questions or concerns. This video offers some helpful examples of how schools and SBHCs can better work together within their mutual laws and regulations. (2) School staff should understand the scope of services, since some misinformed", "laws and regulations. (2) School staff should understand the scope of services, since some misinformed voices have spread rumors that SBHCs provide abortion services or gender reassignment surgery. (They do not.) (3) SBHC providers can be inundated with non-revenue generating tasks such as basic first aid or consultations with teachers. Although some of these activities are valuable, it may help to educate school and district personnel up front about providers’ scope of practice and the SBHC revenue model so they become your partners and use your team to the highest level. Collaborating with front office staff, school nurses, and administrators - as well as classroom teachers - can really make a difference for maximizing the skills of all those involved."]}, "heading_number": 5, "subheading_number": null, "heading_page_number": 10, "excerpt": "<p>This section provides practical guidance for School-Based Health Center (SBHC) staff and lead agencies to operate effectively by setting realistic budgets, securing stable funding, establishing clear agreements, hiring dedicated staff, and fostering strong relationships with school personnel.

The program covers family planning, sexual assault, pregnancy-related services, outpatient mental health and substance abuse services. Minors of any age can qualify for pregnancy and pregnancy-related services, family planning services and sexual assault services. Minors ages 12 to 20 can qualify for these services as well as STD treatment, drug and alcohol abuse treatment and counseling, and outpatient mental health treatment and counseling. To qualify for these services a minor must be unmarried and considered living in the home of a parent or guardian; foster youth and other minors under the care of public agencies are not eligible. The program allows the minor to qualify based on only the minor’s income and property and NOT that of the parent or guardian; thus, most adolescents qualify. (Proof of income may be required for any income the minor has.) Clients must be California residents but do not need to be citizens, have proof of documentation or provide a Social Security number. They can be eligible even if they have full scope Medi-Cal or private insurance if other criteria are met. Minor Consent Medi-Cal Mental Health Services Minors are only eligible for outpatient mental health treatment and counseling through the program if a mental health professional: [1] attests that the minor is mature enough to participate intelligently in the mental health treatment or counseling AND that the minor is either: (a) In danger of causing serious physical or mental harm to themselves or others without mental health treatment or counseling; OR (b) An alleged victim of incest or child abuse. This is documented in a written statement from the mental health professional which states that the child needs mental health treatment or counseling, the estimated length of time treatment will be needed, and that the minor meets these criteria shown above. Minor Consent Medi-Cal recipients do not have full-scope Medi-Cal benefits and instead have access to a narrow scope of services with the specific scope dependent on the aid code assigned. Applications for Minor Consent Medi-Cal must be processed by eligibility workers working for County Social Service Agencies. Many SBHCs have relationships with these workers to help complete applications or expedite the process. Since the COVID pandemic, most counties have accepted applications and returned eligibility information via phone or email; this flexibility is expected to become permanent.

These represent an opportunity for SBHCs to support students and introduce their services, especially those without adequate health coverage or without a strong health home. SBHCs can partner with their schools to promote services such as the following: Sports physicals: All students, including those with a regular PCP, may benefit from receiving a comprehensive sports physical at their SBHC. It is convenient, student-centered, and thorough, and the results can be shared with the outside provider if there is a signed records release. (A reminder that if a student has private coverage such as Kaiser, you should not expect to be reimbursed.) New students and newcomers: It is often helpful to host special clinic days just for students registering at the school for the first time. During visits on these clinic days, SBHCs can enroll eligible children into the CHDP Gateway program, provide the required services (well-child physicals, immunizations, dental screenings, etc.), and schedule any required follow-up appointments. School-wide screening: Many SBHCs are offering population health services by screening an entire grade or school for things like dental caries, STIs, mental health, trauma and social determinants of health. Each of these efforts is evidence-based and offers the opportunity to identify young people in need of the services offered by the SBHC and therefore build its reimbursement base. One Oakland SBHC holds an annual two-day event targeting every 9th grade student in the school. SBHC staff coordinate with 9th grade teachers to visit their classrooms to conduct a 30-minute presentation.

These represent an opportunity for SBHCs to support students and introduce their services, especially those without adequate health coverage or without a strong health home. SBHCs can partner with their schools to promote services such as the following: Sports physicals: All students, including those with a regular PCP, may benefit from receiving a comprehensive sports physical at their SBHC. It is convenient, student-centered, and thorough, and the results can be shared with the outside provider if there is a signed records release. (A reminder that if a student has private coverage such as Kaiser, you should not expect to be reimbursed.) New students and newcomers: It is often helpful to host special clinic days just for students registering at the school for the first time. During visits on these clinic days, SBHCs can enroll eligible children into the CHDP Gateway program, provide the required services (well-child physicals, immunizations, dental screenings, etc.), and schedule any required follow-up appointments. School-wide screening: Many SBHCs are offering population health services by screening an entire grade or school for things like dental caries, STIs, mental health, trauma and social determinants of health. Each of these efforts is evidence-based and offers the opportunity to identify young people in need of the services offered by the SBHC and therefore build its reimbursement base. One Oakland SBHC holds an annual two-day event targeting every 9th grade student in the school. SBHC staff coordinate with 9th grade teachers to visit their classrooms to conduct a 30-minute presentation.

Schools may want to consider communicating with the followinggroups to provide valuable information, as well as seek feedback and answer questions regardingthe screening.Parents/Guardians and StudentsEncouraging the involvement of parents/guardians before asking consent to conduct a screeningis a valuable approach. The positive involvement of parents/guardians may include engagingthem in the process of setting goals for a screening initiative and in the selection of methods foridentifying mental health problems. Explaining the purpose and intended use of screening toolsto students, in language they can understand, is also important.What schools can do:• Prepare the school and the broader community by providing information about mentalhealth, screening, and treatment. This approach may include educating residents about themental health problems that exist in the community and the resources that are needed toaddress those problems.• Address parental/guardian concerns regarding the impact of “screening” students (e.g.,labeling and identifying students, stigma associated with risk factors).•Involve families and community stakeholders in the planning of an early identificationinitiative so their concerns are identified and addressed (e.g., conduct focus groups,ensure that the planning team has parent/guardian and student members).• Make special efforts to solicit the input and involvement of students and their families aswell as the input of different cultural groups in the local community to learn about theirbeliefs and attitudes about mental health.Screening tools generally focus on indications of problems. However, it is imperative thatschools use such tools thoughtfully in a strengths-based context. Partnering with a familyadvocacy or youth advocacy organization can help in planning and implementing a family-friendly or youth-friendly approach. Introducing the screening initiative can present anopportunity to provide information about mental health problems and the value and nature ofintervention and treatment, which helps frame the discussion in a strengths-based context.Involving students in decisions that impact them can benefit their emotional health and wellbeingby helping them to feel part of the school and wider community and to have some control overtheir lives. At an individual level, benefits include helping students to gain belief in their owncapabilities, including building their knowledge and skills to make healthy choices anddeveloping their independence. Collectively, students benefit from having opportunities toinfluence decisions, to express their views and to develop strong social networks.School StaffInvolving school staff in the development of a screening process and communicating the intentand outcomes will facilitate “buy in” and cooperation. Teachers and other staff members oftenprovide critical input. Sharing information and communicating with staff in the following waysmay be helpful:• Communicate screening process and procedures• Provide professional development around implementation and data-based decisionmaking• Share data and information:o Graphs presented at staff meetingso Progress of students and effectiveness of systemso Screening procedures reviewed prior to each implementationo Connecting outcome data to interventions for studentsCommunity Organizations/AgenciesCommunity providers augment the work of school staff and ensure access to the full continuumof programs and services for all students. Partnering with community agencies allow schools tomaximize resources and options available to students and families.Considerations for communicating with community partners include:• Develop a memorandum of understanding/agreement of clearly defined roles andresponsibilities• Provide professional development around implementation of screening process• Share data and information regarding outcomes (upon parental consent)• Communicate legal/ethical guidelinesEthical and legal considerationsBefore implementing any form of systematic screening, it is important to review any relevantfederal, state, local and district guidelines that may help determine the legality, ethics, andtypical policy of conducting universal screenings in schools. It is important to emphasize that thescreening described in this toolkit does not fulfill the legal requirements under IDEA. Schoolsshould reference IDEA regulations regarding “child find” requirements and permissible“screening.” However, there is general guidance provided on many issues related to behavioralhealth screening.FERPA and HIPAAThe relationship between the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and theHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule, oftencreates confusion on the part of school administrators, health care professionals, and others as tohow these two laws apply to records maintained on students. When schools engage in mentalhealth screening, knowing which laws apply and how they will impact the use andcommunication of screening results is critical. The U.S. Department of Health and HumanServices and the U.S. Department of Education issued “Joint Guidance on the Application of theFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) And the Health Insurance Portability andAccountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) To Student Health Records”(https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/doc/ferpa-hipaa-guidance.pdf). This document seeksto answer many questions that school officials and others have had about the intersection of thesefederal laws.In addition, SAMHSA funds the Center of Excellence for Protected Health Information whichdevelops and disseminates training, technical assistance, and educational resources for healthcarepractitioners, families, individuals, states, and communities on various privacy laws andregulations as they relate to information about mental and substance use disorders. These includethe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and 42 CFR Part 2.

PPRA affords parents/guardians of elementary and secondary students certain rightsregarding the conduct of surveys, collection and use of information for marketing purposes, andcertain physical exams. These include, but are not limited to, the right to:• Consent before students are required to submit to a survey that concerns one or more ofthe following protected areas (“protected information survey”) if the survey is funded inwhole or in part by a program of the U.S. Department of Education (ED)1. Political affiliations or beliefs of the student or student’s parent;2. Mental or psychological problems of the student or student’s family;3. Sex behavior or attitudes;4.

Instructional material used as part of the educational curriculum.These rights transfer from the parents/guardians to a student who is 18 years old or anemancipated minor under State law. A template for PPRA notification to parents/guardians is inAppendix I.Obtaining Informed Parental ConsentA school must have in place clearly written procedures that comply with a state’s legalrequirements for requesting consent and notifying legal guardians or students of the results ofscreening activities. These procedures should identify specific circumstances in which theinformation will be shared with other service providers. Schools should consider the followingfactors when implementing key steps of the screening process:If the legal guardian is to be the informant, getting parental consent is straightforward.The school needs to:• Explain that the tool can help identify if the student has a social or emotional challenge;•Inform the legal guardians that if such a challenge is identified, they will be assisted infollowing up on the information;• Explain confidentiality;• Let parents/guardians know that they and their students are not required to complete thetool or answer any question they find objectionable; and• Encourage legal guardians to ask questions and express concerns about their student’ssocial and emotional development.If the legal guardian will not be present when the screening tool is administered, the schoolneeds to obtain written, informed consent from the legal guardian. Passive consent fromparents/guardians may be obtained, if there is a provision for the parent and/or student to “optout” of the screening. The following steps have been found to be helpful in answering legalguardians’ questions and addressing their concerns:• Provide information about the tool, the process, and follow-up assistance;• Provide a contact name for someone who can answer questions; and• Make a copy of the screening tool available to the legal guardians.It is recommended that organizations require active consent, which means that a student is notscreened unless the legal guardian has signed a consent form and returned it to the school.However, properly executed passive consent procedures are appropriate. The WisconsinDepartment of Public Instruction has developed a “question and answer” document(https://dpi.wi.gov/sites/default/files/imce/sped/pdf/rti-consent.pdf) that provides guidance onobtaining consent for screeningObtaining the Assent of StudentsAlthough most minors cannot provide legal consent, schools should seek informed assent from astudent who is asked to complete a screen. Assent is the willing agreement to participate in anactivity for which the purpose and process has been explained and any alternatives have beendiscussed. In addition to being the right thing to do, assent is a practical necessity when theinformant’s willingness to participate openly is critical to obtaining useful results. In many cases,it may be advisable to document a student’s informed assent with a signed assent form. A studentwho has communicated unwillingness to participate can refuse to participate even when his orher legal guardians have given formal consent. Some schools find it useful to develop guidingprinciples, such as those developed by the Early Identification Workgroup of theFederal/National Partnership (FNP) for Transforming Child and Family Mental Health andSubstance Abuse Prevention and Treatment.Principles Guiding Screening for Early Identification of Mental Health Problems in Children and AdolescentsDeveloped by the Early Identification Workgroup of the Federal/National Partnership (FNP) for Transforming Childand Family Mental Health and Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment, December 18, 2006.1. First, do no harm.2. Obtain informed consent.• Screening should be a voluntary process—except in emergency situations, which preclude obtaining consentprior to screening. In these circumstances, consent should be obtained as soon as possible during or afterscreening.•Informed consent for screening a student should be obtained from parents, guardians, or the entity with legalcustody of the student. Informed assent from students should be obtained. Clear, written procedures forrequesting consent and notifying parents/guardians and students of the results of early identification activitiesshould be available.3. Use a scientifically sound screening process.• All screening instruments should be shown to be valid and reliable in identifying students in need of furtherassessment.• Screening must be developmentally, age, gender, and racially/ethnically/culturally appropriate for the studentto the greatest degree possible and use of results should be informed by potential limits to validity as indicated.• Early identification procedures and approaches should respect and take into consideration the norms,languages, and cultures of communities and families.• Any person conducting screening and involved with the screening process should be qualified andappropriately trained.4. Safeguard the screening information and ensure its appropriate use.• Screening identifies only the possibility of a problem and should never be used to make a diagnosis or to labelthe student.• Confidentiality must be appropriately ensured and limits to confidentiality must be clearly shared within thescope of obtaining informed consent/assent (e.g., when immediate steps must be taken to protect life in anemergency situation).5. Link to assessment and treatment services.•If problems are detected, screening must be followed by notifying parents, students, guardians, or the entitywith legal custody; explaining the results; and offering referral for an appropriate, in-depth assessmentconducted by trained personnel with linkages to appropriate services and supports.", "chunks": ["Involvement of stakeholder groups prior to initiating screening is important to maximize theeffectiveness of the process.

The following steps have been found to be helpful in answering legalguardians’ questions and addressing their concerns:• Provide information about the tool, the process, and follow-up assistance;• Provide a contact name for someone who can answer questions; and• Make a copy of the screening tool available to the legal guardians.It is recommended that organizations require active consent, which means that a student is notscreened unless the legal guardian has signed a consent form and returned it to the school.However, properly executed passive consent procedures are appropriate. The WisconsinDepartment of Public Instruction has developed a “question and answer” document(https://dpi.wi.gov/sites/default/files/imce/sped/pdf/rti-consent.pdf) that provides guidance onobtaining consent for screeningObtaining the Assent of StudentsAlthough most minors cannot provide legal consent, schools should seek informed assent from astudent who is asked to complete a screen. Assent is the willing agreement to participate in anactivity for which the purpose and process has been explained and any alternatives have beendiscussed. In addition to being the right thing to do, assent is a practical necessity when theinformant’s willingness to participate openly is critical to", "do, assent is a practical necessity when theinformant’s willingness to participate openly is critical to obtaining useful results. In many cases,it may be advisable to document a student’s informed assent with a signed assent form. A studentwho has communicated unwillingness to participate can refuse to participate even when his orher legal guardians have given formal consent. Some schools find it useful to develop guidingprinciples, such as those developed by the Early Identification Workgroup of theFederal/National Partnership (FNP) for Transforming Child and Family Mental Health andSubstance Abuse Prevention and Treatment.Principles Guiding Screening for Early Identification of Mental Health Problems in Children and AdolescentsDeveloped by the Early Identification Workgroup of the Federal/National Partnership (FNP) for Transforming Childand Family Mental Health and Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment, December 18, 2006.1. First, do no harm.2. Obtain informed consent.• Screening should be a voluntary process—except in emergency situations, which preclude obtaining consentprior to screening. In these circumstances, consent should be obtained as soon as possible during or afterscreening.•Informed consent for screening a student should be obtained from parents, guardians, or the entity with legalcustody of the student. Informed assent from students should be obtained. Clear, written procedures forrequesting consent and notifying parents/guardians and students of the results of early identification activitiesshould be available.3. Use a scientifically sound screening process.• All screening instruments should be shown to be valid and reliable in identifying students in need of furtherassessment.• Screening must be developmentally, age, gender, and racially/ethnically/culturally appropriate for the studentto the greatest degree possible and use of results should be informed by potential limits to validity as indicated.• Early identification procedures and approaches should respect and take into consideration the norms,languages, and cultures of communities and families.• Any person conducting screening and involved with the screening process should be qualified andappropriately trained.4. Safeguard the screening information and ensure its appropriate use.• Screening identifies only the possibility of a problem and should never be used to make a diagnosis or to labelthe student.• Confidentiality must be appropriately ensured and limits to confidentiality must be clearly shared within thescope of obtaining informed consent/assent (e.g., when immediate steps must be taken to protect life in anemergency situation).5. Link to assessment and treatment services.•If problems are detected, screening must be followed by notifying parents, students, guardians, or the entitywith legal custody; explaining the results; and offering referral for an appropriate, in-depth assessmentconducted by trained personnel with linkages to appropriate services", "offering referral for an appropriate, in-depth assessmentconducted by trained personnel with linkages to appropriate services and supports."]}, "heading_number": 16, "subheading_number": null, "heading_page_number": 27, "excerpt": "<p>Effective mental health screening in schools requires early involvement and clear communication with parents, students, school staff, and community organizations to ensure understanding, consent, and collaboration.

Sometimes these mental healthpartners are integrated in the school setting through school-based mental health clinics or are inthe community setting. Organizations that serve students may be reluctant to screen for studentswith mental health or substance use problems if they believe that appropriate assessment andtreatment are not available. When organizations anticipate an access-to-care problem, theyshould explore the willingness of the local mental health and substance abuse treatmentcommunity to support a planned identification initiative. Treatment providers are likely toexperience busy times of the year; as a result, providers may be more willing and able toaccommodate referrals from a screening program if the program is scheduled for a less busy timeof year.The School Mental Health Referral Pathways (SMHRP) Toolkit(https://knowledge.samhsa.gov/resources/school-mental-health-referral-pathways-toolkit) wasfunded by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) tohelp state and local education agencies and their partners develop effective systems to referyouth to mental health service providers and related supports. The SMHRP Toolkit providesbest-practice guidance and practical tools and strategies to improve coordination andcollaboration, both within schools and between schools and other youth-serving agencies. TheSMHRP Toolkit supports the cultivation of systems that improve the well-being of young peopleby providing targeted mental health supports at the earliest sign that a need is present. TheSMHRP Toolkit delves deeply into the topic of referral pathways, which are defined as theseries of actions or steps taken after identifying a student with a potential mental and/orsubstance use issue. Referral pathways vary from community to community based on culturaland linguistic considerations and the resources available, including the public and privateorganizations providing services to school-aged students. School and community-based mentaland substance use providers must understand their local community to ensure the seamlessprovision of supports to students and their families. While referral pathways may involvedifferent partners, depending on the community, all effective referral pathways share similarcharacteristics:• They define the roles and responsibilities of all partners in a system.• They have clearly articulated procedures for managing referrals within and betweenpartners.• They share information efficiently across partners.• They monitor the effectiveness of the evidence-based interventions provided by allpartners within a system.• They make intervention decisions collaboratively based on what is best for young peopleand their families.The SMHRP Toolkit provides sample memorandums of understanding (MOUs) between schooldistricts and community providers.The School-based Mental Health Model adopted by the Arkansas Department of Education(http://www.arkansased.gov/public/userfiles/Learning_Services/School_Health_Services/SBMH_Manual_June2012.pdf) is based on a strong foundation of collaboration and cooperationbetween mental health providers and school districts. Partners share information readily andeasily, having established mechanisms to support this prior to implementation of the programthrough an interagency agreement and/or business associate agreement.Potential clinical partners include:1. Private practitionersHealth professionals who are willing to support the early identification process and acceptreferrals to assess students with positive screens.2. Local community mental health centersIn many states, community mental health centers receive state, county, and Medicaid funds toserve children, adolescents, and adults with mental health problems. Some centers also mayparticipate as providers for private health care plans. These centers may be able to acceptreferrals and generally have some funding to serve students without insurance coverage. Theyalso may be able to refer organizations to the major providers serving private health plans.3. Public substance abuse clinicsPublicly supported substance abuse clinics often serve Medicaid-eligible and uninsured people.Although services for teens may be limited, they do exist. A list of clinics in a statemay be found by contacting the state’s substance abuse and Medicaid agencies.4. Local community health centersCommunity health centers provide primary health care for individuals on Medicaid or for thosewho are uninsured. Increasingly, such centers also provide mental health services or havepartnerships with providers who serve their primary care clients. The Health Resources andServices Administration (HRSA) provides a “Find a Health Center” Web site(http://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/) to locate community health centers in specific areas.SAMHSA has developed the Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator(https://www.findtreatment.samhsa.gov/), a confidential and anonymous source of informationfor persons seeking treatment facilities in the United States or U.S. Territories for mental andsubstance use disorders.5. HospitalsHospitals are often willing to collaborate on plans to improve health in their local communities.If hospitals offer psychiatric outpatient services or have affiliated mental health programs, theyare likely to participate in the provider networks of many health plans and can be a source of carefor students who are members of those health plans. Some hospitals also may accept Medicaid orhave funds to provide free care for uninsured students.6. Non-clinical partnersIt is important for schools to consider other potential partners beyond clinical referrals. Studentsand families will often need and consider “non-clinical” supports before accepting therapeuticinterventions.Additional Non-Clinical Community Partners and SupportsPeer supportFamilies and students may prefer peer-based services, either as a primary source of treatment, or in addition toengaging in more formal behavioral health treatment services. Consequently, family and student supportgroups play a valuable role in helping families negotiate service systems, educate themselves about their child’scondition, or cope with the demands of a child with special needs. Schools should seek to partner with or offerreferrals to family and student support organizations operating within their state.Faith communitiesCommunities of faith can be important partners by providing prevention activities andsupport to their members and the broader community. Many families and students are more likely to seekassistance and support from Faith leaders than from clinical providers.Go: Engaging in ScreeningThe Fairhaven School District Behavioral Health Team has prepared the school staff ingrades 6 and 9 for the screening process. They are using an online screening tool, sostudent data will be immediately collected, scored, and stored for reference.

They are set to GO!", "chunks": ["Schools frequently use school-employed mental health professionals (e.g., school psychologists,social workers) or partner with mental health and substance abuse providers to ensure thatidentified students have access to assessment and treatment. Sometimes these mental healthpartners are integrated in the school setting through school-based mental health clinics or are inthe community setting. Organizations that serve students may be reluctant to screen for studentswith mental health or substance use problems if they believe that appropriate assessment andtreatment are not available. When organizations anticipate an access-to-care problem, theyshould explore the willingness of the local mental health and substance abuse treatmentcommunity to support a planned identification initiative. Treatment providers are likely toexperience busy times of the year; as a result, providers may be more willing and able toaccommodate referrals from a screening program if the program is scheduled for a less busy timeof year.The School Mental Health Referral Pathways (SMHRP) Toolkit(https://knowledge.samhsa.gov/resources/school-mental-health-referral-pathways-toolkit) wasfunded by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) tohelp state and local education agencies and their partners develop effective systems to referyouth to mental health service providers and related supports. The SMHRP Toolkit providesbest-practice guidance and practical tools and strategies to improve coordination andcollaboration, both within schools and between schools and other youth-serving agencies. TheSMHRP Toolkit supports the cultivation of systems that improve the well-being of young peopleby providing targeted mental health supports at the earliest sign that a need is present. TheSMHRP Toolkit delves deeply into the topic of referral pathways, which are defined as theseries of actions or steps taken after identifying a student with a potential mental and/orsubstance use issue. Referral pathways vary from community to community based on culturaland linguistic considerations and the resources available, including the public and privateorganizations providing services to school-aged students. School and community-based mentaland substance use providers must understand their local community to ensure the seamlessprovision of supports to students and their families. While referral pathways may involvedifferent partners, depending on the community, all effective referral pathways share similarcharacteristics:• They define the roles and responsibilities of all partners in a system.• They have clearly articulated procedures for managing referrals within and betweenpartners.• They share information efficiently across partners.• They monitor the effectiveness of the evidence-based interventions provided by allpartners within a system.• They make intervention decisions collaboratively based on what is best for young peopleand their families.The SMHRP Toolkit provides sample memorandums of understanding (MOUs) between schooldistricts and community providers.The School-based", "families.The SMHRP Toolkit provides sample memorandums of understanding (MOUs) between schooldistricts and community providers.The School-based Mental Health Model adopted by the Arkansas Department of Education(http://www.arkansased.gov/public/userfiles/Learning_Services/School_Health_Services/SBMH_Manual_June2012.pdf) is based on a strong foundation of collaboration and cooperationbetween mental health providers and school districts. Partners share information readily andeasily, having established mechanisms to support this prior to implementation of the programthrough an interagency agreement and/or business associate agreement.Potential clinical partners include:1. Private practitionersHealth professionals who are willing to support the early identification process and acceptreferrals to assess students with positive screens.2. Local community mental health centersIn many states, community mental health centers receive state, county, and Medicaid funds toserve children, adolescents, and adults with mental health problems. Some centers also mayparticipate as providers for private health care plans. These centers may be able to acceptreferrals and generally have some funding to serve students without insurance coverage. Theyalso may be able to refer organizations to the major providers serving private health plans.3. Public substance abuse clinicsPublicly supported substance abuse clinics often serve Medicaid-eligible and uninsured people.Although services for teens may be limited, they do exist. A list of clinics in a statemay be found by contacting the state’s substance abuse and Medicaid agencies.4. Local community health centersCommunity health centers provide primary health care for individuals on Medicaid or for thosewho are uninsured. Increasingly, such centers also provide mental health services or havepartnerships with providers who serve their primary care clients. The Health Resources andServices Administration (HRSA) provides a “Find a Health Center” Web site(http://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/) to locate community health centers in specific areas.SAMHSA has developed the Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator(https://www.findtreatment.samhsa.gov/), a confidential and anonymous source of informationfor persons seeking treatment facilities in the United States or U.S. Territories for mental andsubstance use disorders.5. HospitalsHospitals are often willing to collaborate on plans to improve health in their local communities.If hospitals offer psychiatric outpatient services or have affiliated mental health programs, theyare likely to participate in the provider networks of many health plans and can be a source of carefor students who are members of those health plans. Some hospitals also may accept Medicaid orhave funds to provide free care for uninsured students.6. Non-clinical partnersIt is important for schools to consider other potential partners beyond clinical referrals. Studentsand families will often need and consider “non-clinical” supports before accepting therapeuticinterventions.Additional Non-Clinical Community Partners and SupportsPeer supportFamilies and students may prefer peer-based services, either as a primary source", "Partners and SupportsPeer supportFamilies and students may prefer peer-based services, either as a primary source of treatment, or in addition toengaging in more formal behavioral health treatment services. Consequently, family and student supportgroups play a valuable role in helping families negotiate service systems, educate themselves about their child’scondition, or cope with the demands of a child with special needs. Schools should seek to partner with or offerreferrals to family and student support organizations operating within their state.Faith communitiesCommunities of faith can be important partners by providing prevention activities andsupport to their members and the broader community. Many families and students are more likely to seekassistance and support from Faith leaders than from clinical providers.Go: Engaging in ScreeningThe Fairhaven School District Behavioral Health Team has prepared the school staff ingrades 6 and 9 for the screening process.

If the school has chosen to usean evidenced-based screening tool, “cut scores” or threshold points for level of risk will beidentified by the instrument. Screening results and potential actions will include:• Positive for risk – need further assessment• Some risk - monitor• Negative for risk – nothing or multiple screeningHowever, it is important to engage in a few steps prior to taking any actions with students.The first step in the intervention process is to review the validity of the list of students identifiedby the screening to be at each level of potential risk. Vet the list with classroom teachers, studentassistance teams, leadership teams, a school psychologist, or school counselor and check for anystudents whose screening results are surprises to school personnel. This can be an opportunity todiscuss why students may appear “under the radar” and who may be candidates for immediateprevention programming versus a monitoring approach where teachers are notified of thepotential risk and are monitored by the Behavioral Health Team but are not asked to do anythingformal. There may be students for whom teachers feel are listed as “at risk” inaccurately.Teachers may self-disclose that their ratings were skewed because of something in the classroomor a personal conflict with the student. If students are self-rating, there may also have somesurprising results that warrant discussion. However, this feedback from teachers should notsubstitute for a full exploration of factors potentially impacting upon students.Checking the validity of screening results also provides information about the degree to whichteachers may perceive many students in an extreme way. In instances like these, it may be thatintervention is needed for the teacher and student or that additional support is needed for ateacher’s classroom management skills, behavior management strategies, or perspectives onappropriate grade- and age-level expectations.After a list of screening results is vetted by a small group of professionals, those studentsdetermined to meet the criteria for being “at-risk” need further assessment to determine the needfor supports and intervention. It is important to note that students with indicators for extreme risk(e.g., threats to harm self or others, violence potential) need immediate assessment andintervention. Engaging in “threat assessment” or violence potential is a different process than thescreening for risk factors associated withadjustment problems in students. Thistype of assessment needs to beimplemented by trained professionals.Other students who present some riskmay be placed on a “monitor” list, which allows for a tracking of these students to watch forchanges in their risk potential. Students who present no risk do not need any immediate followup. However, all students should be included in any subsequent universal screenings.For those students with indicators for risk, Vannest (2011) has developed Targeted InterventionPlanning (TIP). TIP is an efficient process for quickly bringing prevention and interventionservices to students after universal screening. TIP involves problem identification, interventionselection, teacher training, fidelity of implementation, and progress monitoring.Problem identificationThe first step post screening is problem identification. Once a student is determined to be “atrisk,” further assessment is conducted to determine the level of risk and intensity of interventionneeded. Some schools may contract with community providers to conduct follow-up assessmentand treatment after a positive screen. However, schools can also conduct school-based follow-upassessment. Administration of broad-based behavioral assessments (e.g., BASC-2, ConnersCBRS) is one method to follow up on a positive risk screening. It is important to get additionalparental consent for this behavioral assessment. The results from a behavioral rating scale allowschools to target and triage behavior and emotional problems for prevention and intervention.Other options for further assessment of students with identified risk include parent/studentinterviews to assess severity of risk factors and observations in the classroom.Sample Notification to Parents/Guardians (Vannest, 2012)Dear Parent or Guardian,Our school district cares about the academic progress, health, and well-being of each of ourstudents. After our hearing, vision, behavior, and academic risk screenings this fall, resultsindicate your student may be at risk in the area of:____ Behavior and emotion____ Hearing____ Vision____ AcademicsTo ensure that all students perform well in school, the school requests permission for____Teacher rating of student behavior or performance (see attached consent form)____ (List other options here)If you have any questions or concerns about this information, please contact us at_________________Intervention selectionAfter identifying one or more problem area(s) to target, interventions best matched to addressthose problems are selected. Interventions and supports are based upon the available resources inthe school and/or community (see Resource Mapping discussed in section 3-Ready:Implementation Planning). Interventions are based upon the needs of the student, level ofseverity, and availability and location of services. Dr. Olga Acosta Price (personalcommunication, June 25, 2018), Director of the George Washington University Center forHealth and Health Care in Schools, indicates that no school system can handle ALL students’mental health needs on its own and the need to think about partnerships to accomplish this work.Typical responses by schools to students identified as “at-risk” include referral for services toschool-employed mental health professionals, partner mental health agencies co-located in theschool, or community professionals. These may include brief, time limited interventions orlonger-term therapy. However, it is also important to consider “non-clinical” type interventionsbased upon the type of risk and needs of the students. “Non-clinical” interventions can includementoring either in school or in the community, connection to school or community activities(e.g., sports, clubs, social activities, peer supports), and financial and/or legal services.• Promising Practices Network. http://www.promisingpractices.net/programs.asp• CASEL: Collaborative for Academic, Social and Emotional Learning (SEL programs).http://www.casel.org/programs/index.php• CSPV: Prevention Research Center for the Promotion of Human Development at Penn State,the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence. http://prevention.psu.edu/• USDOE: The United States Department of Education’s Exemplary and Promising Safe,Disciplined, and Drug-Free Schools Programs 2001 (USDOE) (US).http://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/exemplary01/exemplary01.pdf• CSMHA: Center for School Mental Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine(Recognized Evidence-based Programs Implemented by Expanded School Mental HealthPrograms).http://www.schoolmentalhealth.org/Resources/Clin/QAIRsrc/Summary%20of%20Recognized%20Evidence%20Based%20Programs6.14.08.doc• Blueprints for Violence Prevention: Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence, Universityof Colorado at Boulder. http://www.colorado.edu/cspv/blueprints/matrix.html• OJJDP: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, US Department of Justice.http://ojjdp.ncjrs.gov/programs/mpg.html• Find Youth Info: Evidence-based Program Directory.http://www.FindYouthInfo.gov/ProgramSearch.aspx• The California Evidence-based Clearinghouse. http://www.cebc4cw.org/search/selectTeacher TrainingTeachers and other staff are often important components of interventions selected to supportstudents at risk. However, implementation of interventions without appropriate preparation ofthose who may be responsible for assisting with the support can lead to poor outcomes. Vannest(2012) recommends “use of step-by-step directions with brief teacher training to build capacity.”Teachers are more likely to support intervention use when outcomes are positive. Positiveoutcomes occur most frequently when there is a close match between problem and treatment.Therefore, using data to match interventions to problems and using evidenced-basedinterventions are important. Building capacity to use prevention and intervention strategiesoccurs over time, with support, leadership, and coaching.Fidelity of ImplementationImplementation fidelity or “treatment integrity” refers to the degree to which an intervention orprogram is delivered as intended. Whether an intervention to an at-risk student is provided withinthe school or in the community, some type of fidelity check should be built into the process. Thiscan be accomplished by using evidenced-based programs which generally incorporate fidelitychecks into the program. However, all school staff members need to be properly trained toensure that the intervention is being implemented as intended. Schools can also build in fidelitychecks (e.g., implementation checklists, peer ratings of implementation, administrativeobservation). Creating forms where adult peers can provide praise and feedback is a nice way tomake this a positive rather than a punitive experience. Also, when teachers see other teachersexecuting plans and implementing strategies that are incorporated into academic instruction, theyare more likely to learn new practices, feel like the strategies are relevant, and maintain adoption.Studies show that teachers distrust research and the longer they are in the field, the less likelythey are to rely on professional literature (Cook, Landrum, Tankersley, & Kauffman, 2003). Peermodeling and support is important to ensure staff “buy-in.”Progress monitoringWhen students at risk have been identified, problems targeted, interventions selected, teacherstrained, and fidelity checked, then student response can be monitored. It is helpful to havebaseline data regarding student responses for the sake of comparison to screening later in theschool year. Progress monitoring is the frequent repeated measurement of a specific and clearlydefined behavior or construct (Parker, Vannest, Davis, & Clemens, 2010). Progress monitoring isan essential component both for evaluation of student needs and response to individualizedinterventions. Schools may want to consider utilizing a screening tool that can be used for theinitial screening of risk assessment, as well as a progress monitoring tool. For example, theBoston Public Schools Comprehensive Behavior Health Model program(http://cbhmboston.com/) uses the Behavior Intervention Monitoring Assessment System(BIMAS-2) as an initial screener, and progress monitoring tool.", "chunks": ["After universal screening, behavioral health teams are in possession of a comprehensive listidentifying the relative risk status of students in their population.

Vet the list with classroom teachers, studentassistance teams, leadership teams, a school psychologist, or school counselor and check for anystudents whose screening results are surprises to school personnel. This can be an opportunity todiscuss why students may appear “under the radar” and who may be candidates for immediateprevention programming versus a monitoring approach where teachers are notified of thepotential risk and are monitored by the Behavioral Health Team but are not asked to do anythingformal. There may be students for whom teachers feel are listed as “at risk” inaccurately.Teachers may self-disclose that their ratings were skewed because of something in the classroomor a personal conflict with the student. If students are self-rating, there may also have somesurprising results that warrant discussion. However, this feedback from teachers should notsubstitute for a full exploration of factors potentially impacting upon students.Checking the validity of screening results also provides information about the degree to whichteachers may perceive many students in an extreme way. In instances like these, it may be thatintervention is needed for the teacher and student or that additional support is needed for ateacher’s classroom management skills, behavior management strategies, or perspectives onappropriate grade- and age-level expectations.After a list of screening results is vetted by a small group of professionals, those studentsdetermined to meet the criteria for being “at-risk” need further assessment to determine the needfor supports and intervention. It is important to note that students with indicators for extreme risk(e.g., threats to harm self or others, violence potential) need immediate assessment andintervention. Engaging in “threat assessment” or violence potential is a different process than thescreening for risk factors associated withadjustment problems in students. Thistype of assessment needs to beimplemented by trained professionals.Other students who present some", "in students. Thistype of assessment needs to beimplemented by trained professionals.Other students who present some riskmay be placed on a “monitor” list, which allows for a tracking of these students to watch forchanges in their risk potential. Students who present no risk do not need any immediate followup. However, all students should be included in any subsequent universal screenings.For those students with indicators for risk, Vannest (2011) has developed Targeted InterventionPlanning (TIP). TIP is an efficient process for quickly bringing prevention and interventionservices to students after universal screening. TIP involves problem identification, interventionselection, teacher training, fidelity of implementation, and progress monitoring.Problem identificationThe first step post screening is problem identification. Once a student is determined to be “atrisk,” further assessment is conducted to determine the level of risk and intensity of interventionneeded. Some schools may contract with community providers to conduct follow-up assessmentand treatment after a positive screen. However, schools can also conduct school-based follow-upassessment. Administration of broad-based behavioral assessments (e.g., BASC-2, ConnersCBRS) is one method to follow up on a positive risk screening. It is important to get additionalparental consent for this behavioral assessment. The results from a behavioral rating scale allowschools to target and triage behavior and emotional problems for prevention and intervention.Other options for further assessment of students with identified risk include parent/studentinterviews to assess severity of risk factors and observations in the classroom.Sample Notification to Parents/Guardians (Vannest, 2012)Dear Parent or Guardian,Our school district cares about the academic progress, health, and well-being of each of ourstudents. After our hearing, vision, behavior, and academic risk screenings this fall, resultsindicate your student may be at risk in the area of:____ Behavior and emotion____ Hearing____ Vision____ AcademicsTo ensure that all students perform well in school, the school requests permission for____Teacher rating of student behavior or performance (see attached consent form)____ (List other options here)If you have any questions or concerns about this information, please contact us at_________________Intervention selectionAfter identifying one or more problem area(s) to target, interventions best matched to addressthose problems are selected. Interventions and supports are based upon the available resources inthe school and/or community (see Resource Mapping discussed in section 3-Ready:Implementation Planning). Interventions are based upon the needs of the student, level ofseverity, and availability and location of services. Dr. Olga Acosta Price (personalcommunication, June 25, 2018), Director of the George Washington University Center forHealth and Health Care in Schools, indicates that no school system can handle ALL", "Center forHealth and Health Care in Schools, indicates that no school system can handle ALL students’mental health needs on its own and the need to think about partnerships to accomplish this work.Typical responses by schools to students identified as “at-risk” include referral for services toschool-employed mental health professionals, partner mental health agencies co-located in theschool, or community professionals. These may include brief, time limited interventions orlonger-term therapy. However, it is also important to consider “non-clinical” type interventionsbased upon the type of risk and needs of the students. “Non-clinical” interventions can includementoring either in school or in the community, connection to school or community activities(e.g., sports, clubs, social activities, peer supports), and financial and/or legal services.• Promising Practices Network. http://www.promisingpractices.net/programs.asp• CASEL: Collaborative for Academic, Social and Emotional Learning (SEL programs).http://www.casel.org/programs/index.php• CSPV: Prevention Research Center for the Promotion of Human Development at Penn State,the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence. http://prevention.psu.edu/• USDOE: The United States Department of Education’s Exemplary and Promising Safe,Disciplined, and Drug-Free Schools Programs 2001 (USDOE) (US).http://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/exemplary01/exemplary01.pdf• CSMHA: Center for School Mental Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine(Recognized Evidence-based Programs Implemented by Expanded School Mental HealthPrograms).http://www.schoolmentalhealth.org/Resources/Clin/QAIRsrc/Summary%20of%20Recognized%20Evidence%20Based%20Programs6.14.08.doc• Blueprints for Violence Prevention: Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence, Universityof Colorado at Boulder. http://www.colorado.edu/cspv/blueprints/matrix.html• OJJDP: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, US Department of Justice.http://ojjdp.ncjrs.gov/programs/mpg.html• Find Youth Info: Evidence-based Program Directory.http://www.FindYouthInfo.gov/ProgramSearch.aspx• The California Evidence-based Clearinghouse. http://www.cebc4cw.org/search/selectTeacher TrainingTeachers and other staff are often important components of interventions selected to supportstudents at risk. However, implementation of interventions without appropriate preparation ofthose who may be responsible for assisting with the support can lead to poor outcomes. Vannest(2012) recommends “use of step-by-step directions with brief teacher training to build capacity.”Teachers are more likely to support intervention use when outcomes are positive. Positiveoutcomes occur most frequently when there is a close match between problem and treatment.Therefore, using data to match interventions to problems and using evidenced-basedinterventions are important. Building capacity to use prevention and intervention strategiesoccurs over time, with support, leadership, and coaching.Fidelity of ImplementationImplementation fidelity or “treatment integrity” refers to the degree to which an intervention orprogram is delivered as intended. Whether an intervention to an at-risk student is provided withinthe school or in the community, some type of fidelity check should be built into the process. Thiscan be accomplished by using evidenced-based programs which generally incorporate fidelitychecks into the program. However, all school staff members need to be", "which generally incorporate fidelitychecks into the program. However, all school staff members need to be properly trained toensure that the intervention is being implemented as intended. Schools can also build in fidelitychecks (e.g., implementation checklists, peer ratings of implementation, administrativeobservation). Creating forms where adult peers can provide praise and feedback is a nice way tomake this a positive rather than a punitive experience. Also, when teachers see other teachersexecuting plans and implementing strategies that are incorporated into academic instruction, theyare more likely to learn new practices, feel like the strategies are relevant, and maintain adoption.Studies show that teachers distrust research and the longer they are in the field, the less likelythey are to rely on professional literature (Cook, Landrum, Tankersley, & Kauffman, 2003). Peermodeling and support is important to ensure staff “buy-in.”Progress monitoringWhen students at risk have been identified, problems targeted, interventions selected, teacherstrained, and fidelity checked, then student response can be monitored. It is helpful to havebaseline data regarding student responses for the sake of comparison to screening later in theschool year. Progress monitoring is the frequent repeated measurement of a specific and clearlydefined behavior or construct (Parker, Vannest, Davis, & Clemens, 2010). Progress monitoring isan essential component both for evaluation of student needs and response to individualizedinterventions. Schools may want to consider utilizing a screening tool that can be used for theinitial screening of risk assessment, as well as a progress monitoring tool. For example, theBoston Public Schools Comprehensive Behavior Health Model program(http://cbhmboston.com/) uses the Behavior Intervention Monitoring Assessment System(BIMAS-2) as an initial screener, and progress monitoring tool."]}, "heading_number": 24, "subheading_number": null, "heading_page_number": 54, "excerpt": "<p>After universal behavioral health screening, schools review and validate risk levels with staff before determining appropriate interventions, which range from monitoring to immediate assessment for high-risk students.

ISF is animplementation framework that creates and guides the linkage between education and mental healthsystems to leverage and maximize the benefits of bothsystems ofcare for students.Pulaski County Schools have been a leader inKentuckywith integrating educational and mental healthsystemsand have recently added a core foundational activityof universalscreening for behavioral health needs.

Regular physical activity benefits both the body and mind.” 1 The following activities are starting points for health and well-being: • Start with the Mindful Meditation Moment for that specific day. • Follow with Stay-Fit stretches and exercises (choose as many as time allows). • Remind staff to go at their own pace and to do what feels manageable, as each person’s limits, flexibility and range are different and to stop immediately if at any time someone starts to feel uncomfortable. • Make sure to keep your water bottle nearby and stay hydrated! Stay Fit Stretches and Exercises As we shelter-in-place, most likely you and your staff are more sedentary than usual. Planning a simple self-care boost through stretching and low-impact cardio activities at the start of your virtual staff meeting not only promotes health and well-being for your staff, but also models how much you value everyone’s wellness.

It is also important that your needsassessment gather information about the ways culture and history in your community influence views about health careand education. Common questions that needs assessments can answer are listed below.• What are the biggest health problems and/or concerns for students and the community?•How are these concerns different for different segments of students or community members, for example, basedon gender, race, class, and ethnicity?•In what ways do race and culture influence views about health and education in the community?• What community and school health resources already exist?• Which health facilities, programs and services are used most, by whom, and why?• What are the barriers to care for students and families?•How are services coordinated?•Are different segments of the community satisfied with the current set of services?•Given the needs and existing services, what are the gaps?•How have previously implemented programs worked? For which segments of the community did they work wellor not work well and why?• Would the school-based health center model be best suited to meet student and community needs? Shouldother models be considered?• What will it take to make the school-based health center effective in serving all of the different segments of thestudent body and community you hope to reach?• What resources are available for a school-based health center and what additional resources do you need?• Who are the key persons and agencies that need to be involved in program planning and implementation?There are many ways to answer the questions listed above. You will most likely need to use a few different strategies inorder to answer all your questions. The strategies for collecting data for a needs assessment are the same as those you usefor evaluation but with a different focus. These include collecting your own data through surveys, focus groups, publicforums, or key informant interviews, as well as compiling data from existing sources such as statewide surveys, publichealth records, or school data. A description of each of these different types of data is included below.In 2021, the California School-Based Health Alliance created a free and publicly available resource that combines datasources to help individuals advocate and plan locally for new school-based health centers. The Student Health Index(https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/student-health-index/) is the first statewide comprehensive analysis to identifythe counties, districts, and schools where new SBHCs will have the greatest return on investment for improving studenthealth and education equity. To make the Student Health Index more accessible, a dashboard was created to provide apublic, interactive mapping tool that spans all large K-12 public schools in the state of California, and allows users to view,download, and explore school-level data on health, socioeconomic, and school demographics and outcomes. The Indexand Dashboard can be a helpful resource as a part of or in conjunction with your needs assessment.The California Department of Health Care Services, California Department of Public Health, California Department ofEducation, and local health departments collect and make available a wide variety of public health indicator data. Thestate departments as well as larger counties make these data available via searchable databases.It is important to track down health and education data for your area to determine your school’s health care needs. Itwill also prove helpful later when you start writing grant proposals. The following table provides some useful onlineresources. Local public health departments and even school districts may have access to regional and local data aboutstudent health outcomes and gaps in services.

Common questions that needs assessments can answer are listed below.• What are the biggest health problems and/or concerns for students and the community?•How are these concerns different for different segments of students or community members, for example, basedon gender, race, class, and ethnicity?•In what ways do race and culture influence views about health and education in the community?• What community and school health resources already exist?• Which health facilities, programs and services are used most, by whom, and why?• What are the barriers to care for students and families?•How are services coordinated?•Are different segments of the community satisfied with the current set of services?•Given the needs and existing services, what are the gaps?•How have previously implemented programs worked? For which segments of the community did they work wellor not work well and why?• Would the school-based health center model be best suited to meet student and community needs? Shouldother models be considered?• What will it take to make the school-based health center effective in serving all of the different segments of thestudent body and community you hope to reach?• What resources are available for a school-based health center and what additional resources do you need?• Who are the key persons and agencies that need to be involved in program planning and implementation?There are many ways to answer the questions listed above. You will most likely need to use a few different strategies inorder to answer all your questions. The strategies for collecting data for a needs assessment are the same as those you usefor evaluation but with a different focus. These include collecting your own data through surveys, focus groups, publicforums, or key informant interviews, as well as compiling data from existing sources such as statewide surveys, publichealth records, or school data. A description of each of these different types of data is included below.In 2021, the California School-Based Health Alliance created a free and", "of data is included below.In 2021, the California School-Based Health Alliance created a free and publicly available resource that combines datasources to help individuals advocate and plan locally for new school-based health centers. The Student Health Index(https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/student-health-index/) is the first statewide comprehensive analysis to identifythe counties, districts, and schools where new SBHCs will have the greatest return on investment for improving studenthealth and education equity. To make the Student Health Index more accessible, a dashboard was created to provide apublic, interactive mapping tool that spans all large K-12 public schools in the state of California, and allows users to view,download, and explore school-level data on health, socioeconomic, and school demographics and outcomes. The Indexand Dashboard can be a helpful resource as a part of or in conjunction with your needs assessment.The California Department of Health Care Services, California Department of Public Health, California Department ofEducation, and local health departments collect and make available a wide variety of public health indicator data. Thestate departments as well as larger counties make these data available via searchable databases.It is important to track down health and education data for your area to determine your school’s health care needs. Itwill also prove helpful later when you start writing grant proposals. The following table provides some useful onlineresources. Local public health departments and even school districts may have access to regional and local data aboutstudent health outcomes and gaps in services.

Medi-Cal is California’s Medicaid health insurance program. Using a combinationof federal and state funding, it covers a variety of medical services for children and adults with limited income andresources. About half of children in California are covered by Medi-Cal.There are many different Medi-Cal aid codes depending on the individual’s eligibility and program. Most low-incomechildren and youth qualify for “full-scope” Medi-Cal with a comprehensive benefits package that includes physical health,mental health, dental and vision services.The California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) administers the Medi-Cal program, and determines programeligibility, benefits, provider payment and beneficiary cost-sharing levels. DHCS works closely with the federal Centersfor Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which provides regulatory oversight, and each of California’s 58 counties alsoplays a key role in implementing the Medi-Cal program. Counties are responsible for conducting eligibility determination,enrollment and recertification within specified eligibility rules.There are several ways to apply for Medi-Cal including by phone, in person at a local county social services office, athospitals and clinics where county eligibility workers are located, and/or with assistance from Certified ApplicationAssistants (CAAs) working in community organizations. Some of the Medi-Cal programs described below have simplified,expedited and/or presumptive eligibility processes that are well suited for SBHC settings.Medi-Cal providers must be licensed and accredited according to the specific laws and regulations that apply to theirservice type. Application criteria include having an established place of business and proof of liability insurance coverageand professional liability insurance coverage. Providers must complete an application packet specific to their providertype. Provider application packages are available at https://files.medi-cal.ca.gov/pubsdoco/prov_enroll.aspx.The following are the types of Medi-Cal coverage most frequently utilized by California SBHCs.Most children who qualify for comprehensive, “full scope” Medi-Cal coverage through their families are enrolled inmanaged care plans. As of December 2021, children under age 19 qualify for Medi-Cal if the family’s household income isless than 266% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) - about $61,260 for a family of three and $86,371 for a family of five.6Managed care plans differ by county and include commercial plans like Anthem Blue Cross as well as “Local Initiatives’’such as LA Care or the Partnership HealthPlan of California. Some counties operate a single health system for their Medi-Cal population while others offer multiple managed care plans. A list of Medi-Cal managed care plans by county can befound at https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/individuals/Pages/MMCDHealthPlanDir.aspxMedi-Cal managed care plans contract for health care services through established providers and networks of care. SBHCsthat want to join this network must enter contracts with the health plan(s) in their county and this includes credentialingindividual medical and mental health clinicians.Primary Care: All Medi-Cal managed care beneficiaries select or are assigned to a Primary Care Provider (PCP) which canbe a private physician or physician group, community health center, county health clinic, Kaiser Permanente, or otherarrangement. Primary care providers are generally paid a capitated monthly amount per member per month. Althoughsome SBHCs act as official managed care PCPs, many are not able to provide the continuity during the week or the yearrequired to fulfill this role, even if they are the primary place that young people receive medical care. FQHCs typically actas Medi-Cal managed care PCPs for hundreds or thousands of Medi-Cal members.Even if an SBHC is not the PCP for a given student, they may be eligible for reimbursement. They can provide episodicprimary care and be reimbursed through the CHDP program (see below), fee-for-service Medi-Cal, or by the health plandirectly through contractual agreement. And although it is more complicated with respect to referrals and billing, SBHCsrun by FQHCs can receive their full Medi-Cal PPS reimbursement rate when they provide care to Medi-Cal beneficiariesthat are assigned to other clinics or providers.(See letter from DHCS at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AVnCeQuZY3PBy_pX04dxe9Umai6eaQB1/view?usp=sharing)Note: If Kaiser Permanente is the managed care plan the student is enrolled in, providers should not expect any directreimbursement from the plan.Mental Health: Medi-Cal managed care plans are responsible for contracting with a network of mental health providersthat can provide evaluation, testing, and outpatient non-specialty mental health services. Some of these health planscontract with an intermediary mental health plan such as Beacon Health Options to credential providers and adjudicate/pay claims. Appropriately trained and licensed mental health providers working in an SBHC may be eligible to join thesenetworks even if the medical providers are not part of the primary care network.As with primary care services, SBHCs can be reimbursed for care provided by covered providers even if the patient isassigned to another PCP.More information is available in CSHA’s Behavioral Health Sustainability Guide:https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/sustaining-behavioral-health.MINOR CONSENT MEDI-CAL MENTALIn California, individuals under 21 years old may apply for a specialHEALTH SERVICESconfidential program called Minor Consent Medi-Cal without parent orMinors are only eligible for outpatientguardian consent or knowledge.

They can be eligible even if they have fullscope Medi-Cal or private insurance if other criteria are met.Minor Consent Medi-Cal recipients do not have full-scope Medi-Cal benefits and instead have access to a narrow scope ofservices with the specific scope dependent on the aid code assigned.Applications for Minor Consent Medi-Cal must be processed by eligibility workers working for County Social Service Agencies.Many SBHCs have relationships with these workers to help complete applications or expedite the process. Since the COVIDpandemic, most counties have accepted applications and returned eligibility information via phone or email; this flexibilityis expected to become permanent. In general, Minor Consent Medi-Cal eligibility is issued on a month-to-month basis withapplications for ongoing coverage submitted monthly. Currently no coverage is being terminated during the COVID pandemicand the state is considering permanent changes to the coverage period (e.g., to 6 or 12 months).For more information SBHCs should contact their local Social Services Agency or see if their local clinic consortium is able to help athttps://www.cpca.org/CPCA/About/Membership/Regional_Associations_of_California_RAC/CPCA/About/Regional_Associations_of_California__RAC_.aspx?hkey=3fa4bb68-d085-4bd1-98a0-752271cfec78.In California, specialty mental health services are “carved out” of the broader Medi-Cal program, meaning that specialtymental health services for children and adults are provided through county mental health plans instead of throughmanaged care health plans with the rest of the Medi-Cal benefits. Often county specialty mental health services forchildren may be referred to as “EPSDT services” but EPSDT (which stands for “Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis andTreatment”) refers to the comprehensive health services available to children and youth enrolled in Medi-Cal, not justspecialty mental health services.“Specialty mental health services” include:•rehabilitative mental health services (including mental health services, medication support services, daytreatment intensive, day rehabilitation, crisis intervention, crisis stabilization, adult residential treatment services,crisis residential treatment services, and psychiatric health facility services);•psychiatric inpatient hospital services;•targeted case management;•psychiatric and psychologist services;•EPSDT supplemental specialty mental health services; and•psychiatric nursing facility services.Medi-Cal children and youth are eligible for all medically necessary specialty mental health services if either of thefollowing criteria are met:1. The beneficiary has a condition placing them at high risk for a mental health disorder due to experience of trauma7OR2. The beneficiary meets both of the following requirements:a. The beneficiary has a significant impairment or a reasonable probability of significant deterioration or ofnot progressing developmentally ANDb. The condition is a diagnosed or suspected mental health disorder or a result of significant trauma placingthe beneficiary at risk of a future mental health condition, based on the assessment of a licensed mentalhealth professional.When a Medi-Cal beneficiary age 21 or younger meets medical necessity and these access criteria, the county mentalhealth plan is responsible for providing, or arranging for the provision of, specialty mental health services. These servicescan be provided directly by county-employed staff or counties may contract with community-based organizations.County mental health plans vary significantly in how they deliver specialty mental health services. The options availablefor schools and SBHCs to work with their counties to deliver specialty mental health services depends, in large part, onthe county’s overall system of care, priorities, and how school-based strategies align.•School-based health centers or community providers - Many counties contract for the delivery of specialtymental health services through community providers. These providers can be community mental and behavioralhealth agencies, individual practitioners, healthcare providers like federally qualified health centers, and/orschool-based health centers.•School district providers – In some cases, the school district or county office of education can contract directlywith the county mental health plan to become a contracted provider of specialty mental health services. Howeverthis arrangement is not common as provider qualifications and billing requirements can be significant barriers.•County providers – In counties where the majority of specialty mental health services are provided “in house,” i.e. bycounty-employed mental health professionals, schools can develop arrangements with the county to have permanentor periodic county-employed clinicians provide assessment and treatment services on the school campus.An increasing number of SBHCs offer some dental prevention or treatment services onsite. Dental services are often asignificant area of need in low-income communities.All children covered by full-scope Medi-Cal (i.e., those with family incomes less than 266% of federal poverty) also havecoverage for dental services. Covered benefits are comprehensive and include cleaning, exams, x-rays, sealants, fluoridevarnish and restorative treatments such as fillings.Most pediatric dental providers are already enrolled in the Denti-Cal program; if not, they can enroll through the DentalServices Division of the Department of Health Care Services: https://www.dental.dhcs.ca.gov/Dental_Providers/Medi-Cal_Dental/Provider_Enrollment_Outreach/. In Sacramento and Los Angeles Counties, some of these benefits areadministered by Managed Dental Care Organizations.For SBHCs operated by Community Health Centers and FQHCs, there is no enrollment in the Denti-Cal program. Instead,these services can be delivered and claimed using the same all-inclusive PPS rate that is used for eligible medical andbehavioral health services. CHCs can also elect to include Registered Dental Hygienists in their Scope of Services bysubmitting a Change in Scope Request.

Medi-Cal is California’s Medicaid health insurance program. Using a combinationof federal and state funding, it covers a variety of medical services for children and adults with limited income andresources. About half of children in California are covered by Medi-Cal.There are many different Medi-Cal aid codes depending on the individual’s eligibility and program. Most low-incomechildren and youth qualify for “full-scope” Medi-Cal with a comprehensive benefits package that includes physical health,mental health, dental and vision services.The California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) administers the Medi-Cal program, and determines programeligibility, benefits, provider payment and beneficiary cost-sharing levels. DHCS works closely with the federal Centersfor Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which provides regulatory oversight, and each of California’s 58 counties alsoplays a key role in implementing the Medi-Cal program. Counties are responsible for conducting eligibility determination,enrollment and recertification within specified eligibility rules.There are several ways to apply for Medi-Cal including by phone, in person at a local county social services office, athospitals and clinics where county eligibility workers are located, and/or with assistance from Certified ApplicationAssistants (CAAs) working in community organizations. Some of the Medi-Cal programs described below have simplified,expedited and/or presumptive eligibility processes that are well suited for SBHC settings.Medi-Cal providers must be licensed and accredited according to the specific laws and regulations that apply to theirservice type. Application criteria include having an established place of business and proof of liability insurance coverageand professional liability insurance coverage. Providers must complete an application packet specific to their providertype. Provider application packages are available at https://files.medi-cal.ca.gov/pubsdoco/prov_enroll.aspx.The following are the types of Medi-Cal coverage most frequently utilized by California SBHCs.Most children who qualify for comprehensive, “full scope” Medi-Cal coverage through their families are enrolled inmanaged care plans. As of December 2021, children under age 19 qualify for Medi-Cal if the family’s household income isless than 266% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) - about $61,260 for a family of three and $86,371 for a family of five.6Managed care plans differ by county and include commercial plans like Anthem Blue Cross as well as “Local Initiatives’’such as LA Care or the Partnership HealthPlan of California. Some counties operate a single health system for their Medi-Cal population while others offer multiple managed care plans. A list of Medi-Cal managed care plans by county can befound", "multiple managed care plans. A list of Medi-Cal managed care plans by county can befound at https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/individuals/Pages/MMCDHealthPlanDir.aspxMedi-Cal managed care plans contract for health care services through established providers and networks of care. SBHCsthat want to join this network must enter contracts with the health plan(s) in their county and this includes credentialingindividual medical and mental health clinicians.Primary Care: All Medi-Cal managed care beneficiaries select or are assigned to a Primary Care Provider (PCP) which canbe a private physician or physician group, community health center, county health clinic, Kaiser Permanente, or otherarrangement. Primary care providers are generally paid a capitated monthly amount per member per month. Althoughsome SBHCs act as official managed care PCPs, many are not able to provide the continuity during the week or the yearrequired to fulfill this role, even if they are the primary place that young people receive medical care. FQHCs typically actas Medi-Cal managed care PCPs for hundreds or thousands of Medi-Cal members.Even if an SBHC is not the PCP for a given student, they may be eligible for reimbursement. They can provide episodicprimary care and be reimbursed through the CHDP program (see below), fee-for-service Medi-Cal, or by the health plandirectly through contractual agreement. And although it is more complicated with respect to referrals and billing, SBHCsrun by FQHCs can receive their full Medi-Cal PPS reimbursement rate when they provide care to Medi-Cal beneficiariesthat are assigned to other clinics or providers.(See letter from DHCS at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AVnCeQuZY3PBy_pX04dxe9Umai6eaQB1/view?usp=sharing)Note: If Kaiser Permanente is the managed care plan the student is enrolled in, providers should not expect any directreimbursement from the plan.Mental Health: Medi-Cal managed care plans are responsible for contracting with a network of mental health providersthat can provide evaluation, testing, and outpatient non-specialty mental health services. Some of these health planscontract with an intermediary mental health plan such as Beacon Health Options to credential providers and adjudicate/pay claims. Appropriately trained and licensed mental health providers working in an SBHC may be eligible to join thesenetworks even if the medical providers are not part of the primary care network.As with primary care services, SBHCs can be reimbursed for care provided by covered providers even if the patient isassigned to another PCP.More information is available in CSHA’s Behavioral Health Sustainability Guide:https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/sustaining-behavioral-health.MINOR CONSENT MEDI-CAL MENTALIn California, individuals under 21 years old may apply for a specialHEALTH SERVICESconfidential program called Minor Consent Medi-Cal without parent orMinors are only eligible for outpatientguardian", "specialHEALTH SERVICESconfidential program called Minor Consent Medi-Cal without parent orMinors are only eligible for outpatientguardian consent or knowledge.

Since the COVIDpandemic, most counties have accepted applications and returned eligibility information via phone or email; this flexibilityis expected to become permanent. In general, Minor Consent Medi-Cal eligibility is issued on a month-to-month basis withapplications for ongoing coverage submitted monthly.

Often county specialty mental health services forchildren may be referred to as “EPSDT services” but EPSDT (which stands for “Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis andTreatment”) refers to the comprehensive health services available to children and youth enrolled in Medi-Cal, not justspecialty mental health services.“Specialty mental health services” include:•rehabilitative mental health services (including mental health services, medication support services, daytreatment intensive, day rehabilitation, crisis intervention, crisis stabilization, adult residential treatment services,crisis residential treatment services, and psychiatric health facility services);•psychiatric inpatient hospital services;•targeted case management;•psychiatric and psychologist services;•EPSDT supplemental specialty mental health services; and•psychiatric nursing facility services.Medi-Cal children and youth are eligible for all medically necessary specialty mental health services if either of thefollowing criteria are met:1. The beneficiary has a condition placing them at high risk for a mental health disorder due to experience of trauma7OR2. The beneficiary meets both of the following requirements:a. The beneficiary has a significant impairment or a reasonable probability of significant deterioration or ofnot progressing developmentally ANDb. The condition is a diagnosed or suspected mental health disorder or a result of significant trauma placingthe beneficiary at risk of a future mental health condition, based on the assessment of a licensed mentalhealth professional.When a Medi-Cal beneficiary age 21 or younger meets medical necessity and these access criteria, the county mentalhealth plan is responsible for providing, or arranging for the provision of, specialty mental health services. These servicescan be provided directly by county-employed staff or counties may contract with community-based organizations.County mental health plans vary significantly in how they deliver specialty mental health services. The options availablefor schools and SBHCs to work with their counties to deliver specialty mental health services depends, in large part, onthe county’s overall system of care, priorities, and how school-based strategies align.•School-based health centers or community providers - Many counties contract for the delivery of specialtymental health services through community providers. These providers can be community mental and behavioralhealth agencies, individual practitioners, healthcare providers like federally qualified health centers, and/orschool-based", "community mental and behavioralhealth agencies, individual practitioners, healthcare providers like federally qualified health centers, and/orschool-based health centers.•School district providers – In some cases, the school district or county office of education can contract directlywith the county mental health plan to become a contracted provider of specialty mental health services. Howeverthis arrangement is not common as provider qualifications and billing requirements can be significant barriers.•County providers – In counties where the majority of specialty mental health services are provided “in house,” i.e. bycounty-employed mental health professionals, schools can develop arrangements with the county to have permanentor periodic county-employed clinicians provide assessment and treatment services on the school campus.An increasing number of SBHCs offer some dental prevention or treatment services onsite. Dental services are often asignificant area of need in low-income communities.All children covered by full-scope Medi-Cal (i.e., those with family incomes less than 266% of federal poverty) also havecoverage for dental services. Covered benefits are comprehensive and include cleaning, exams, x-rays, sealants, fluoridevarnish and restorative treatments such as fillings.Most pediatric dental providers are already enrolled in the Denti-Cal program; if not, they can enroll through the DentalServices Division of the Department of Health Care Services: https://www.dental.dhcs.ca.gov/Dental_Providers/Medi-Cal_Dental/Provider_Enrollment_Outreach/. In Sacramento and Los Angeles Counties, some of these benefits areadministered by Managed Dental Care Organizations.For SBHCs operated by Community Health Centers and FQHCs, there is no enrollment in the Denti-Cal program. Instead,these services can be delivered and claimed using the same all-inclusive PPS rate that is used for eligible medical andbehavioral health services. CHCs can also elect to include Registered Dental Hygienists in their Scope of Services bysubmitting a Change in Scope Request.

The application process is simple, does not require income verification, and can be completed online by SBHCstaff with no County worker involved. SBHCs can use the CHDP Gateway program to enroll students into temporary full-scope Medi-Cal effective that day through the next calendar month. Then a joint Medi-Cal/Covered California applicationis sent to the family home and a parent/guardian can continue the child’s Medi-Cal coverage by completing it.For more information or to become a CHDP provider, contact your local CHDP program office:http://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/chdp/Pages/countyoffices.aspxPlease note that California plans to eliminate the CHDP program by July 1, 2023 in order to simplify and streamline thedelivery of services to children and youth under age 21, in alignment with the goals of the California Advancing andInnovating Medi-Cal (CalAIM) initiative. Presumptive eligibility services will continue under a new Children’s PresumptiveEligibility program which will expand to include all applicable Medi-Cal providers, thereby permitting more providers tomake presumptive eligibility determinations and expanding access to Medi-Cal services for more children/youth.

This can be combined with requesting proof ofimmunizations, or proof of a physical and/or dental visit as required by school districts. When collecting information fromfamilies, SBHCs should request the students’ health insurance information, including member number and expiration date,although families are not accustomed to providing this information to schools. Having the information in advance greatlyfacilitates insurance claims when the student is seen for a reimbursable visit.Some SBHCs are enrolled in portals or other systems that check Medi-Cal coverage online through their lead agency,managed care organization, clinic consortium or other entity. Some may have arrangements with the county social servicesdepartment to allow easy eligibility screening. Most Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are paired with Electronic PracticeManagement Systems (EPMs) that verify Medi-Cal eligibility in real time assuming the patient’s social security or BICnumber is already in the system. Unfortunately there are very few ways to screen for Medi-Cal coverage using just patientdemographics like name and date of birth, and many students do not carry their health insurance cards or even know whatkind of coverage they have, so systems like these can be extremely valuable.Claiming third-party reimbursement requires adequate systems and staff time commitment. Unless an SBHC hasrevenue cycle support from an experienced individual or billing department, it will be difficult to maximize third-partyreimbursement.Most health care billing is now conducted electronically, with a few exceptions, and EPM systems are commonly linked toEHRs to support a streamlined process.An effective revenue cycle includes the initial screening for coverage; provider coding appropriately for services providedwithin this coverage; someone with expertise reviewing this claim before submission; submitting the initial claim for servicesrendered; and mechanisms to track and reconcile payments, correct and re-submit claims, and manage payer denials ina timely manner. The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) estimates that 30% of medical claims are denied orignored on first submission. Common reasons for denials include eligibility errors, diagnosis codes not covered, proceduresnot covered, gender mismatch, and providers not credentialed with insurance plans.Although billing and capturing third-party reimbursement is complex, it is one of the most important factors in developinga sustainable SBHC. Fortunately, most community health providers have billing systems in place and can use these systemsto support their SBHCs in securing reimbursement. CSHA recommends:• Dedicated staff from the SBHC responsible for understanding and keeping current on billing practices that arerelevant to their SBHCs (e.g., changes to the Family PACT program benefit package for high school SBHCs).•Established protocols for staff that provide guidance on how to maximize third-party reimbursement, includinghow to identify and prioritize among the payer options.•Printed billing matrix or “cheat sheets” to help providers code correctly. These should include a breakdown ofservices that are reimbursed by each payer, the diagnosis and treatment codes to use for each payer, and howfrequently diagnosis and treatment codes can be used per patient.•Regular provider meetings to review billing codes and share tips for improved coding. These meetings shouldalso include a review of billing claim denials so providers and support staff learn from missed opportunities.•IT support for EHR configuration and training. SBHCs often need special EHR templates for confidential servicesprovided under the minor’s consent, as well as additional screening for social determinants of health.It is a commonly held myth that if a Medi-Cal managed care member is assigned to a different Primary Care Provider(PCP), the SBHC or its lead agency cannot see the patient or be reimbursed for their care.In fact, there are several exceptions to that rule, especially for SBHCs operated by FQHCs. For one, Medi-Cal managed caremembers have the freedom to receive family planning services from any provider, and this provider must be reimbursedby the health plan even if they are “out of network.”11In addition, for FQHCs, the California Department of Health Care Services has confirmed that out of network visits arereimbursable at an FQHC’s PPS rate. In order to obtain their PPS rate, an SBHC must:a) Be sponsored by an FQHC.b) Document that they reminded the patient be seen by an “in network” provider or redirect the patient back totheir PCP to receive services, or ask that the patient request that the health plan change their PCP to the SBHC.The billing staff of the SBHC or SBHC sponsor agency must:a) Submit a claim for payment to the patient’s health plan for the “out of network” services. In most cases, the SBHCwill receive a denial for these services.b) Maintain proof of the denial or payment from the health plan, which is subject to review during the billingreconciliation process.c) Submit a Code 18, 19, or 20 for these visits.However, if the SBHC is going to continue providing ongoing primary care to the student, it is worth trying to have thefamily change the official PCP. This will establish an ongoing capitation stream and also enable any outside referrals forspecialty care the patient needs.Of course, an SBHC cannot maximize reimbursement if it’s not filling clinician schedules. Even with lower overallproductivity expectations than other settings, SBHCs should be able to generate 8-15 visits per primary care clinician perday and 7-12 for behavioral health providers. But filling these schedules takes ongoing efforts to ensure that students,school staff and families are aware of the services available, especially given regular turnover in students and staff. Somegood outreach strategies include:•SBHCs can include information in school registration material and packets, whether hard copies or electronic.This information should be shared with centralized enrollment or district offices so they can direct new familiestoward the centers as appropriate.• Whenever possible, parent/guardian consent and registration forms should be made available to families.They can be sent with registration packets, made available at school-wide events, and posted on school/districtwebsites. Many SBHCs are now using digital consent forms that can be linked to school announcements andemails to families, thus sharing the links and/or QR codes widely.•Staff should attend school staff meetings to ensure all school staff and administrators understand where theSBHC is, and how to refer to it.•SBHC staff can attend PTSA, School Site Council and other relevant meetings.•SBHC staff should participate actively on Coordination ofOne Oakland SBHC holds an annualService Teams or other events where student needs aretwo-day event targeting every 9thidentified and referrals discussed, always following appropriategrade student in the school.

SBHCs applying for PCC licensure must apply as a Community Clinic, Free Clinic,Mobile Clinic, or Rural Health Clinic. This process typically takes more than 90 business days and often the preparationtakes well over a year. When an SBHC has its own primary care clinic license there is no limit to the number of hours itmay provide health care services. However, this arrangement is not very common because this means that the SBHC is astandalone clinic without a “parent” clinic (see below for more information).Intermittent or Satellite Clinic Site – An SBHC operated by a licensed PCC is exempt from licensing requirements if it isoperated on a separate premises from the licensed PCC and is open no more than 40 hours a week. This is known as anintermittent clinic, sometimes referred to as a satellite site.Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and other medical providers frequently operate SBHCs as intermittent to alicensed, “parent” PCC. The parent PCC provides all staffing, protocols, equipment, supplies, and billing services for theintermittent site.

In California, the VFC Program is administeredby the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Immunization Branch. Through this program, the state contractswith vaccine manufacturers to buy vaccines at reduced rates. Enrolled VFC providers then order vaccines for eligiblechildren through the VFC Program and receive routine vaccines at no cost. To be eligible, children must be 18 years of ageor younger and eligible for Medi-Cal or CHDP, uninsured, or American Indian or Alaskan Native. Children enrolled in theHealthy Families program are not VFC-eligible. Children who have health insurance that does not cover immunizationsmay receive VFC vaccines, but only at federally qualified health centers or rural health clinics.Any California-licensed physician or health care organization serving VFC-eligible children can become a VFC provider.Once certified, VFC providers must record patients’ eligibility status and comply with CDC’s Standards for PediatricImmunization Practices (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00020935.htm). Providers are visitedperiodically by a VFC Field Representative who conducts a Quality Assurance Review.The California Department of Mental Health administers behavioral health programs for children and youth. It is beyondthe scope of this manual to fully outline all the mental health programs in California.

Both a minimum and a recommended scope of servicesare outlined for each type of clinical services provided. There are also minimum guidelines for all types of school-basedhealth centers, some of which are summarized below. Some of the guidelines, such as those related to staff certification,licensing, and facilities, are fully developed in other chapters in this manual.ADMINISTRATION – The school-based health center should have a lead agency with overall responsibility foradministration, operations and oversight. There is an identified staff person responsible for the health center’s overallmanagement, quality of care, and coordination with school personnel.FACILITY/PHYSICAL SITE – All school-based health centers must be housed in a facility, whether stationary or mobile,that is easily identifiable by students, families, and school staff. Best practice for a SBHC is to include at least one clinicalspace and a reception area. See Chapter 8 for more detail on facilities components and planning.ACCESSIBILITY – School-based health centers are intended to increase access to care, especially among traditionallyunderserved populations, and in geographic areas where there is limited access to care.

In an emergency, however, a medical or dental provider may treat a minor who has a conditionor injury which is considered an emergency, but whose parent or guardian is unavailable to give consent. In this case, theprovider should document their effort and the circumstances carefully.REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE – Minors of any age can consent to family planning and contraceptive services withthe exception of sterilization. Minors age 12 and over can consent to their own diagnosis and treatment of sexually-transmitted infections, including HIV. Minor consent law extends to health education provided in a clinic setting but mayNOT extend to classroom health education. If a school-based health center wants to provide family life or sexual healthinformation within the school curriculum, it should consult with its school district’s Board of Education.PREGNANCY-RELATED CARE – Minors may consent to any pregnancy-related care including pregnancy testing, prenatalcare, and abortion. Being pregnant does not by itself, however, emancipate a minor (see below). In other words, a non-emancipated pregnant teen still needs parental consent for primary care, dental, or mental health treatment (unlessother exceptions have been met).MENTAL HEALTH – Recent changes in California law allows minors aged 12 and over to consent to their own mentalhealth care counseling if a mental health professional deems them mature enough to participate intelligently intreatment.

For more information see: https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/NCYL-SUD-Minor-Consent-FAQEMANCIPATED MINORS – In California, emancipated minors may consent to medical, dental, or psychiatric care withoutparental consent. Minors are considered emancipated if they are currently or have been married or are participating inthe armed services. The court may additionally declare a minor emancipated if it finds that the minor:•is at least 14 years old;• willingly lives separate and apart from parent or guardian with the consent or acquiescence of the parent orguardian;•is managing his or her own financial affairs;•does not derive his or her income from criminal activity; AND•emancipation would not be contrary to his or her best interests.In addition, a minor may consent to his/her own medical or dental care if he or she:•is at least 15 years old;•is living separate and apart from the minor’s parents or guardian, with or without the consent of a parent orguardian and regardless of the duration of the separate residence; AND•is managing his/her own financial affairs, regardless of income source.How providers share information about health care services provided to patients is governed by federal and Californialaw, as well as professional ethics. As a general rule, whoever has the right to consent to a given health care service isalso the only individual who can view the records related to that care and is also the only one authorized to control thedisclosure of that information. So, for example, a parent can access their child’s primary care medical and dental records,and permit disclosure of these records to outside parties; however, they may not view or release records related to birthcontrol or pregnancy testing without their minor’s explicit consent.State law does provide for certain exceptions to these confidentiality rules in the following circumstances:•if the provider knows or reasonably suspects that a minor is the victim of child abuse or neglect•if the patient expresses or indicates a threat of serious harm to self or other(s)•if the minor is engaged in sexual activity with a minor which is coerced or exploitative•If a minor under age 16 is involved in sexual activity with an adult age 21 or over•if a minor under age 14 is involved in sexual activity with a minor age 14 or over•if the patient tests positive for certain infectious or communicable diseases such as syphilis, chlamydia,gonorrhea, or HIVIn general, mental health providers should involve a parent or guardian in the treatment of minors unless, in the opinion ofthe treating professional, it would be inappropriate and this is documented in the minor’s record. It should also be noted thathealth care providers may refuse to provide parents or guardians access to a minor’s medical records when they determinethat this access would have a detrimental effect on the minor or the provider’s professional relationship with the minor.School-based health centers should make the rights of clients very explicit during the registration process and early clinicvisits.

Federal HIPAA regulations generallyrestate California law regarding confidentiality and information-sharing. HIPAA permits health care providers to sharehealth information, without written release, to other health care providers, health plans, or contractors for purposes ofdiagnosis, treatment, or payment. In other cases, authorization must be obtained from parents or minors using a HIPAA-compliant release of information form.

All school-based health centersshould guarantee privacy, confidentiality, and a sense of well-being. They should be inviting to students, other clientsand the public and operate within an appropriate physical plant. The facility must have current fire and building safetycertificates and comply with laws and regulations governing health facilities, particularly the Americans with DisabilitiesAct (ADA) and state laboratory requirements. (See Chapter 6 for more information on facilities licensing.) More details oneach of these areas are provided below.Privacy/Confidentiality: The facility’s physical layout should meet students’ need for privacy. The waiting area should notbe visible from an external hallway; the examination/counseling room/s should be secluded from the rest of the healthcenter by walls or partitions; and there should be at least one phone line in a private room. Privacy should be fostered,both acoustically and physically: for example, if walls are not soundproof, white noise machines should be used. If thehealth center serves both adolescents and a wider age group, some clinics provide separate spaces or specific hours ofservice for teen clients so that they do not fear encountering parents or neighbors in the center. Having confidence in theconfidentiality of services is one of the most important factors related to teen usage of a school-based health center.Sense of well-being: School-based health centers should offer a relaxing and soothing atmosphere to foster student andfamily comfort, safety, and calm. Soft colors promote quiet and concentration, and natural light from windows relievesstrain and anxiety. Minimizing noise can lower blood pressure and lessen frustration. Especially in large urban schools,this “safe space” can offer a real respite from the challenges of daily school life, particularly for students with physical oremotional dificulties, or sensory sensitivities.Youth-friendliness: The space should ideally feel appealing and welcoming to adolescent patients. This is a greatopportunity to get input from youth leaders. They can help select colors, posters, and other decorations.Spatial requirements: The spatial requirements for each school-based health center will depend on the programs andservices to be provided.

Health center management should have access tothese controls to ensure a comfortable and sanitary environment for patients. Special attention should be given to theexam room(s), lavatories, and the laboratory.Plumbing: A sink with hot and cold water should be provided in each examination room, each laboratory, and in thelab room/area. Ideally, the laboratory would include two sinks with hot and cold water, and the water controls should behands-free to reduce contamination.Electrical/electronic requirements: Electrical outlets should be provided in all spaces as required by code, which localfacilities staff or contractors will outline for you. The electrical circuit for refrigerators and freezers should remain activeat all times, even when school is not in session, or valuable vaccines may be lost (see Chapter 6 for VFC requirements.)Locations should be identified for telephones, computer terminals, modems and/or local area networks. When possible,the school’s central phone, intercom, and/or public address system should be connected to the school-based healthcenter.Lighting: Natural lighting should supplement artificial lighting in the school-based health center. Lighting in each spaceshould be controlled by the occupant of the space. Special attention should be given to lighting in the space that will beused for vision testing.Sanitary requirements: Surface finishes for floors, walls, windows, window coverings, and counter tops should bedesigned for easy cleaning and sanitizing. Provisions should be made for custodial services and the containment andremoval of biohazardous waste.Display: Identify any requirements for bulletin boards, tack strips, display cases, display racks for educational materials,and chalkboards as required and appropriate.Furniture and equipment: The movable furniture and equipment required for each space should be identified. Thisincludes desks, tables, chairs, bookcases, cots, storage cabinets, file cabinets, computers and printers, telephones,photocopier, wall clocks, refrigerator, freezer, exam table(s), and other medical/dental equipment.ADA requirements: The construction and alteration of most public and non-profit buildings must comply with Title IIIof the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) – the ADA Standards for Accessible Design(https://www.ada.gov/ada_title_III.htm).In health care and educational settings, the standards establish specific dimensions for hallway, doorway, and roomclearance, to name a few. Local district facilities departments as well as contractors will be able to describe and applyADA requirements appropriately.Fire clearance: Fire clearances are required by the Health and Safety Code prior to initial licensing or before any changesto a licensed facility can be approved by the State. State-licensed health care facilities require a fire safety inspection to beconducted by the local fire authority (either City fire department or County Fire Marshall for unincorporated areas).Prior to your application for state licensure, you may request that the fire department conduct a pre-inspection to helpyou identify any possible changes needed. A fire clearance application, site and floor plans, and applicable fees arerequired. The facility may also need local Zoning, Building or Fire Code permits. The Fire Marshal’s Office cannot issue afire clearance until all agencies’ requirements have been met. Contact your local fire department to learn more.Most new school-based health centers require funding to construct or renovate their facility. In order to determine thecapital costs required, follow the steps above to identify the overall square footage involved, including wall thickness,circulation space and any connecting corridors. A budget should then be developed that realistically reflects theestimated cost for new construction, renovations, and/or additions. In addition, the school-based health center facilitiesdevelopment plan should be included in the school district facilities master plan.School-based health centers in California have primarily relied on state and local funding to support construction of theirfacilities. Specific funding available for school-based health center facilities includes:STATE SCHOOL FACILITIES GRANTSThe California Department of Education (CDE) allows school facilities grants, including modernization grants and newconstruction grants, to be used for constructing school-based health centers within existing school facilities.Modernization grants must be used to modernize or update outdated and unsafe facilities. Grants are based on thenumber of students served by the district/school to be modernized and require a 40% local match. Because most districtsuse their entire modernization grant to update classroom and core support facilities, little modernization funding hasbeen used to support school-based health center construction.New construction grants can be used if a school-based health center is being designed and built simultaneously with thenew construction of a school. In this case, the district would develop a facilities master plan, identify potential site(s) for thenew school facility inclusive of the school-based health center, and then the CDE would evaluate and approve the proposal.School districts are required to match 50% of the state grant for new construction.Finally, the CDE has defined a Joint-Use Program under the School Facility Program. This program allows a school districtto utilize funds from a joint-use partner to build projects such as libraries, child care facilities or gymnasiums. Over $100million has been made available for these projects, although the state has generally not recognized school-based healthcenters as a valid use of this funding. Proposed legislation may change this, so planning groups should contact the stateto determine if their project might be eligible for joint-use funding: http://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/fa/sf/jtuse.asp.LOCAL BONDSSome school districts such as the Los Angeles Unified School District are using funds from local bond measures tofinance their local “joint-use” projects, including school-based health center construction. Due to inadequate statefacilities funding, many school districts secure funding for school facilities repair and construction by issuing local generalobligation bonds. These bonds can be authorized with the approval of either 66.67 or 55 percent of the voters in thedistrict. The bonds are repaid with local property tax revenue. School districts can also impose developer fees levied onnew residential, commercial and industrial developments. Developer fees vary significantly by community, depending onthe amount of local development. In fast-growing areas, the fees could make notable contributions to school-based healthcenter construction. Finally, school districts may form special districts to sell bonds for school construction projects, knownas “Mello-Roos” bonds. These bonds require two-thirds voter approval, and are paid off by property owners locatedwithin the special district.CALIFORNIA HEALTH FACILITIES FINANCING AUTHORITY (CHFFA)Medical service providers can sometimes secure facilities funding from CHFFA. CHFFA provides public and non-profithealth care providers with loans, grants, and tax-exempt bonds. CHFFA also provides loans to small and rural healthfacilities through the HELP II Financing Program and offers two grant programs, the Children’s Hospital Program and theCommunity Clinic Grant Program. CHFFA financing may be used for the following project-related costs:•Construction•Remodeling and renovation•Land acquisition (as part of the proposed project)•Acquisition of existing health facilities•Purchase or lease of equipment•Refinancing or refunding of prior debt• Working capital for start-up facilities•Costs of bond issuance, feasibility studies and reimbursement of prior expenses. For more information on grantand loan cycles, go to: http://treasurer.ca.gov/chffa/COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANTS (CDBG)CDBG grants are administered by the California Department of Housing and Community Development, and may alsosupport SBHC facilities construction. The primary federal objective of the CDBG program is the development of viableurban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and by expanding economicopportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. Each year, the program makes funds available toeligible jurisdictions through several allocations; school-based health centers may be constructed or renovated withGeneral CDBG grants. Grant-funded activities must be directed toward the planning of a project which, if brought tocompletion, would be a CDBG-eligible activity in which at least 51 percent of the beneficiaries would be low or moderateincome households.Each year, the program makes funds available to eligible jurisdictions such as cities and city districts. Notices of FundingAvailability are published for each allocation as the funds become available. More information is available athttps://www.hcd.ca.gov/grants-and-funding/programs-active/community-development-block-grant.OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDINGSome foundations will support construction or equipment costs. School sites or districts with a higher tax base may havegeneral facility funds to allocate to school-based health center construction. If a federally qualified health center is goingto be the medical provider, it may have access to funding sources for facilities. The federal stimulus package passed inFebruary 2009 includes $1.5 billion for construction of clinic facilities. Creatively leveraging a variety of state, local andprivate funding sources is likely to be the most effective strategy for garnering adequate funds.This process will differ for school-based and school-linked health centers. Once the facilities design plan for a school-based site has been established, it may be required or advisable to update the school board. A presentation can includean overview of the needs assessment process and results, facilities design plans, and a rationale for how the new healthcenter correlates with district and community goals.If the health center will be on school grounds, preliminary architectural designs should be submitted to the Division ofState Architect (DSA) for review and approval (see https://www.dgs.ca.gov/DSA).12 The DSA requires some fees for ProjectPlan Submittal, and may also charge additional fees for later changes to the plans. Depending on the size of the project,DSA approval may take three months.If approved, the DSA will issue a building permit and construction can begin. A core work group should be formed toguide and troubleshoot facilities construction. Members of this group may vary depending on whether the facility isschool-based or –linked, who owns the land, and also who is the lead agency for the health center.When health centers are constructed on school district property, special attention must be paid to developing clear workplans and timelines with the district facilities personnel and the local school board. District facilities departments areoften understaffed and underfunded, and many school districts will “contract out” construction projects other than basicmaintenance and repair to outside building contractors. The school board should set clear expectations for the oversightand monitoring of construction projects.Once construction is complete, the DSA schedules an inspection. If the facility is approved by the Inspector of Record, theDSA issues a certificate of occupancy. At the same time, the local fire department needs to inspect the property for firesafety. See Appendix K for a memo from DSA about requirements for SBHCs.", "chunks": ["Although designs and needs will vary, there are some considerations which are universal. All school-based health centersshould guarantee privacy, confidentiality, and a sense of well-being. They should be inviting to students, other clientsand the public and operate within an appropriate physical plant. The facility must have current fire and building safetycertificates and comply with laws and regulations governing health facilities, particularly the Americans with DisabilitiesAct (ADA) and state laboratory requirements. (See Chapter 6 for more information on facilities licensing.) More details oneach of these areas are provided below.Privacy/Confidentiality: The facility’s physical layout should meet students’ need for privacy. The waiting area should notbe visible from an external hallway; the examination/counseling room/s should be secluded from the rest of the healthcenter by walls or partitions; and there should be at least one phone line in a private room. Privacy should be fostered,both acoustically and physically: for example, if walls are not soundproof, white noise machines should be used. If thehealth center serves both adolescents and a wider age group, some clinics provide separate spaces or specific hours ofservice for teen clients so that they do not fear encountering parents or neighbors in the center. Having confidence in theconfidentiality of services is one of the most important factors related to teen usage of a school-based health center.Sense of well-being: School-based health centers should offer a relaxing and soothing atmosphere to foster student andfamily comfort, safety, and calm. Soft colors promote quiet and concentration, and natural light from windows relievesstrain and anxiety. Minimizing noise can lower blood pressure and lessen frustration. Especially in large urban schools,this “safe space” can offer a real respite from the challenges of daily school life, particularly for students with physical oremotional dificulties, or sensory sensitivities.Youth-friendliness: The space should ideally feel appealing and welcoming to adolescent patients. This is a greatopportunity to get input from youth leaders. They can help select colors, posters, and other decorations.Spatial requirements: The spatial requirements for each school-based health center will depend on the programs andservices to be provided. The spaces identified below are a partial listing of programs or services, and the range of squarefootage that might be required.

Measures like these should also be used for Quality Improvementplans, and outreach to address gaps in care or population health needs (e.g. vaccinations needed).PAYORS/HEALTH PLANS/FUNDERS – Payors and health plans also collect data on number of their covered patients servedand the care type and quality data (e.g. immunizations rates).

Some outcomes that are likely to be important from the school’sperspective include:•Improved academic performance•Increased attendance•Lower dropout rates•Improved student behavior•Improved school climate•Increased teacher satisfaction and reduced turnover•Increased parent participation in school activities•Increased parent and student satisfactionCLINIC USERS – Clinic users (patients) will “vote with their feet.” If they value the services the health centers provide,they will come; if they do not, they will seek care elsewhere. In this respect, potential clinic users are your most importantaudience. Patients may not be as interested in the graphs and tables you produce from your evaluation as they are in thechanges you make in your services as a result of your evaluation. As you design an evaluation, consider assessing clients’(and potential clients’) perspectives on:•Ease of accessing clinic services•Types of services provided•Hours of operation• Wait time for an appointment•Friendliness of clinic staff•Environment of clinic•Confidentiality•Stigma (or lack thereof ) among peersHEALTH CARE PROVIDERS – Depending on their field and type of organization, health care providers are required tocollect, analyze, and submit data on the quality of care they provide to patients (e.g. UDS measures for CHCs include %of asthmatics who have an asthma action plan on file). Measures like these should also be used for Quality Improvementplans, and outreach to address gaps in care or population health needs (e.g. vaccinations needed).PAYORS/HEALTH PLANS/FUNDERS – Payors and health plans also collect data on number of their covered patients servedand the care type and quality data (e.g. immunizations rates). The health care lead agency will be familiar with what clinicaldata needs to be collected and reported out. Funders may also want data on number of patients served and types ofservices. It can also be helpful to collect qualitative data for funder reports (see section on focus groups and interviews).FAMILY/CAREGIVERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS – Although family and community members may not all use thehealth center, their support can be critical to its long-term sustainability. If community members believe that the school-based health center", "be critical to its long-term sustainability. If community members believe that the school-based health center is making the school or neighborhood safer, helping families, or making the school more successful,they will be more likely to object if clinic funds are threatened. In planning your evaluation, consider the issues that areimportant to the community at large.ELECTED OFFICIALS – Legislators, school board members and other elected officials want to use public resources wiselyand keep their constituents happy. Many of the outcomes of interest to this group will be the same as those for the schooland district. However elected officials will also be interested in health outcomes such as:• Number of children served, especially uninsured• Number of uninsured children enrolled in health insurance• Number of immunizations or physicals given•Access and utilization of behavioral health services•Prevention or youth development programs•The popularity of the school-based health centers among parents and voters•Support for the school-based health center among businesses, community leaders, and other groupsSBHC ADMINISTRATORS – Those involved in planning and managing the school-based health center may be the oneswho make the best use of evaluation data. You will rely on this information to raise funds, demonstrate to local officials thatthe health center is valuable, make staffing and budgetary projections, improve the quality of your services, and verify clientsatisfaction. SBHC managers find that good data make their own jobs easier and more effective."]}, "heading_number": 10, "subheading_number": 2, "heading_page_number": 77, "excerpt": "<p>Evaluations of school-based health centers should consider the diverse needs of various stakeholders, including schools, clinic users, health care providers, funders, families, community members, elected officials, and administrators.

Tailoring evaluation efforts to address these perspectives helps demonstrate the center's value, improve services, and ensure long-term sustainability.</p>", "section_parent_heading_uuid": "f823285d-f235-4d8c-aa5a-6940790c01e8"}

It is not necessary to useall of these sources, however, your evaluation will be strengthened if you use a variety of sources.The vast majority of medical providers are now utilizing electronic rather than paper medical records. SBHCs use avariety of electronic health records (EHRs) such as NextGen, Epic, and eClinicalWorks, to name a few. Most EHRs are alsoconnected to an electronic practice management (EPM) system for purposes of billing and scheduling. EHRs and EPMsstore information about patient demographics, services delivered and, in most cases, can also help produce importantreports about the preventive health care needed by patients and their quality of care (e.g., is their depression improvingor their blood sugar level being maintained).The following set of data elements should be tracked by any EHR:Patient Demographic Information• Date of birth•Gender•Race•Ethnicity•Language spoken at home•Insurance status at visit•Identification of primary care provider•School status (enrolled in this school, another school, or not enrolled)• Other special populations such as foster care, homelessService Delivery Information• Date of service•Provider name and provider type• Diagnosis (ICD-10, DSM-5, and other relevant codes)•CPT and other procedure codes•Place of service•Time spent•Referrals (internal and external)• Other subjective notes about the visit such as treatment plan and communication with parent/guardian or PCPSetting up a clinic data system is a fairly technical process. It is possible to keep data on paper or in an Excel file, but muchmore useful to use a management information system or practice management software. If the school-based healthcenter’s medical provider is a community clinic or county health department, they will likely have a system in place atother sites that can be used in the SBHC. If such a system is not available, you will need outside consultation to select andimplement a data system. Many EHRs are based on adult medicine practices and therefore require some customizationto include the kind of proactive screenings recommended for SBHCs – e.g. for sexual health, depression, anxiety, andsocial determinants of health.13Surveys or questionnaires can be used for both types of evaluation. You can either use a standardized survey (one thathas been created and tested by others) or you can create your own. It is recommended that you create or adapt your ownclient satisfaction survey, so that you can customize it to your unique program. However, it’s best to use a standardizedsurvey for capturing outcomes.Surveys can be anonymous, which is the preferred way to administer a satisfaction survey, or they can have the clients’names and/or “unique identifier” if you want to be sure that the same students took the pre-test as took the post-test.Matching pre- and post-tests is essential if you want a scientifically rigorous evaluation. A “unique identifier” is used topreserve confidentiality and can be the clients’ school identification number or can be constructed using letters of theclients’ names and birthdates.Depending on the content of the survey, if you are using names or unique identifiers, you might need to get activeparental consent for the students to take these surveys, according to California Education Code section 51513.14 If yoursurvey is given anonymously but measures student health risks and behaviors, then passive parental consent can beobtained.15Surveys can be administered in many settings. They can be mailed (for example, a satisfaction survey can be mailedto parents of students served by your school-based health center), administered by telephone, on the Internet (usingtechnology such as Survey Monkey), or taken in person (for example, in the health center or in a classroom).Remember to match your method for collecting survey data to the group(s) you are trying to survey. For example, asurvey collected in the clinic waiting room will miss students/families who do not use the clinic. This approach may besufficient if your goal is to learn about the satisfaction of students who have received services. But if you want to knowabout what additional services to offer, you would also want to reach students who are not currently using the healthcenter. A classroom-based survey will be more effective at reaching all students.Surveys can gather both qualitative and quantitative data. Qualitative data is typically gathered through “open-ended”questions such as, “What do you like best about our school-based health center?” Open-ended questions don’t constrainthe answer and can be a rich source of information and feedback. The downside to this type of question is that it is morelabor intensive to sort through the responses of many surveys. Also, many people won’t take the time to give a responseon an open-ended question because it takes longer. This will be particularly true for students or family members who arenot comfortable with writing.“Closed-ended” questions are multiple choice and produce data that are easy to quantify (e.g., the number of peoplewho checked “always,” “sometimes,” or “never”). The advantage of this type of question is that it is easier to analyze quicklywhen the surveys are returned. The downside is that clients are limited to the choices. This can be partially solved byalways having an open-ended category (e.g., “other”) or a place following a multiple choice or scale question for clients toelaborate. (See Appendix L for sample surveys.)Focus groups or public forums are another way to gather data. A focus group is a small gathering of 6-10 people duringwhich a moderator asks questions about a particular topic. It can be a good way to gather feedback relatively quickly andcan be an excellent precursor to a survey because it can help develop and refine survey questions and topics. It is also agood way to collect qualitative information about more complex issues such as cultural values and concerns. Be careful,however, about generalizing from a focus group. Six to ten people, especially if they are volunteers who have a particularinterest in health, may not represent the entire group.Focus groups are most successful when there is an objective moderator, so if your budget permits, it may be worthwhileto hire a consultant who specializes in planning and facilitating focus groups. If not, begin by brainstorming a set ofopen-ended questions on the topic for which you want feedback. Then recruit participants to your focus group. Be sureto reach out to students and families who do not usually volunteer to participate or you may end up with very skewedresults. Offering food or a small incentive such as a gift card is very helpful in recruiting.Groups generally work best when all the participants are similar (e.g., all youth, all teachers, all parents). Considerconducting separate focus groups for different language groups so that the groups can be conducted in a language that ismost comfortable for participants. Once the group is assembled and some simple ground rules reviewed, ask the questionsand allow everyone attending the opportunity to speak. Be sure to assign someone to take notes or record the meeting.A public forum is a larger venue for getting feedback from stakeholders of your school-based health center. A publicforum is not typically constrained in terms of the number of people who can attend and participate. Usually in a publicforum, a presentation about the topic would precede an open dialogue or opportunity for feedback from the attendees.You could conduct a public forum with the school community (administrators, teachers and staff ), parents, students orthe broader community. Consider having a public forum off-site to reach a wider audience and to get diverse views. Forinstance, ask local churches if they would be willing to host a forum. Resources on how to design and run a focus groupand/or public forum can be found at the end of the chapter.Conducting individual interviews can be a useful strategy for collecting data and is sometimes easier than focus groupsor surveys. Key informants can be any stakeholders in the school, community or even in other arenas, such as health plansor government. Interviews are a useful approach when you think that key informants might be hesitant to attend a focusgroup or fill out a survey. This might be because they are busy, don’t speak English, are not familiar with surveys, or wouldnot be comfortable in a focus group. Often interviews combine both open-ended and closed-ended questions and areusually between 30–60 minutes.It can also be helpful to collect stories and testimonials from providers and school staff on the value of the SBHC.It can be helpful to track whether, following an appointment in the SBHC, a student was sent back to class, home,to the ER, or elsewhere. These measures demonstrate the impact of the SBHC on attendance and the prevention of lost“seat time” while students access health care.", "chunks": ["The following is a brief description of several common ways that you can collect your own data.

{"section_uuid": "e005c7b5-834e-4e5c-9f70-93ab1be75519", "title": "Guidelines for School-Based Health Centers in California", "link": "https://www.schoolhealthcenters.org/resource/vision-to-reality/", "content": {"full_text": "A school-based health center is a facility that delivers one or more of the following clinical service components ona school campus or in an easily accessible alternate location including a mobile health van stationed on or neara school campus. School-based health centers in California may provide one or more of the following clinicalservice areas:• Medical services• Behavioral health services• Oral health servicesSchool-based health centers may be open as full-time or part-time sites.• Full-time sites should be open during all normal school hours with at least one staff person present.(Clinical services are not necessarily available during all of these hours.)• Part-time sites are open limited hours as dictated by need or resources.Research has shown that school-based health centers provide an effective means for students to accesscomprehensive health care, mental health services, health education, prevention services, oral health and socialservices. Parents/guardians find that school-based health centers are an accessible and reliable source of carefor their children that ensure their child’s health needs are being met and that keep the child in school.There is a strong relationship between academic achievement and a child’s physical, emotional and mentalhealth.School-based health centers in California are designed to serve the following purposes:•increase access to medical, dental and behavioral health services•support schools in improving academic outcomes•contribute to public health goals related to disease prevention and control.California’s school-based health centers are located in high-risk communities, communities that are medicallyunderserved, and/or in areas with few health care professionals.Administration1. Every school-based health center should have a lead agency that has overall responsibility for school-based health center administration, operations and oversight. The lead agency is usually the fiscal agentfor the health center and employs the center director/manager. The lead agency may or may not be theclinical services provider.2. There should be an identified staff person responsible for the school-based health center’s overallmanagement, quality of care, and coordination with school personnel.Facilities3. All school-based health centers, regardless of the service components offered, should be housed in afacility, whether stationary or mobile, that is easily identifiable by students, families, and school staff. Thefacility should include at least one confidential treatment space appropriate to services provided, as wellas an additional area for patient and family reception, enrollment, and triage.Staff4. All staff should have appropriate health credentials to practice, including active certification or currentlicensure, as appropriate to their position. Additionally, all staff shall maintain their licensure throughappropriate professional standards.Confidentiality and Privacy Protection5. School-based health centers should ensure confidentiality in the sharing of medical information understate and federal laws including HIPAA, FERPA, and Minor Consent as defined by California law. Thehealth center should annually inform (in writing) enrolled students and their parents/guardians of theirrights and responsibilities regarding:a. confidentialityb. privacyc. safety and securityd.informed consente.release of informationf. financial responsibilityg. minor consent laws and sensitive services in CaliforniaSchool Integration6. School-based health center services are developed based on local assessment of needs and resources.7. Parents, students (at the high school level), school staff and community members are engaged in thedevelopment, oversight, and/or provision of school-based health center services.8. School-based health centers provide services in keeping with district policies.9. There should be a written, formalized relationship between the school or school district and healthproviders. This may be a written contract, memorandum of understanding, or statement of agreementbetween the school district and all outside service providers that comprise the health center describingthe relationship between the district and the provider(s), or between the school district and the leadagency for the health center, which should then have its own written agreement with other providers.The contract or agreement should be active (not expired); the term/length of the agreement should bedecided by both parties involved; the agreement may define a process for reviewing what is working/notworking during the “life” of the agreement.10. School-based health centers should either convene or participate in a school-wide health/wellnesscollaborative. This collaborative should include members from all providers (district, school-basedhealth center, and community) of health or wellness services to the school community. They may use amodel such as the CDC’s coordinated school health program to drive the integration of comprehensiveschool-based health programs. If the school does not have such a collaborative, the school-basedhealth center is responsible for forming and convening it at least twice a year. Distributed/sharedleadership models are recommended.11. School-based health centers develop policies/protocols to coordinate care, ensure continuity of care, andfacilitate case management in partnership with the school and other service providers. School personnelinclude credentialed school nurses, health assistants, administrators, teachers, counselors, and supportpersonnel. One process for this coordination may be through the school’s Student Success Team.12. There should be a process for referring students/families to the health center that is understood andapproved by school staff and administrators. The referral process should facilitate access to careas opposed to relying on the student/family to initiate contact with the health center. Mechanismsfor facilitating access could include: walking the student/family to the health center, assisting withscheduling an appointment, initiating contact from the health center by calling students out of class orcalling families at home (while protecting student confidentiality).13. There should be coordination between the health center and the school nurse or health assistant (ifapplicable) including delineation of roles and responsibilities (especially for state-mandated healthservices in the absence of a school nurse), protocols defining permissions related to sharing ofmedical information (e.g. immunization records, serious medical conditions), procedures for servicecoordination, and reviewing how it is going and adjustments needed.Prevention Programs14. The school-based health center should have a role in school-wide health education and outreach,school-based public health programs, youth development programs, or family support programs.Activities may include: classroom presentations, table/presentation at school functions, lunch timeactivities, posters or displays on campus, presentations to school staff, participation in wellness policycouncils or other health committees, and nutrition and fitness promotion programs. Full-time centersshould participate in/offer at least two school health-promoting activities/year. Part-time centers shouldparticipate in/offer at least one school health-promoting activity/year.15. Unlicensed staff that provides health education, youth development, and/or family support servicesshould be trained in basic health promotion, public health, and/or community engagement principles.A CHES (certified health education specialist) is preferred, though not required.Health Insurance Outreach and Enrollment16. All school-based health centers should take steps to ascertain student insurance coverage, health plan,and primary care provider (if applicable) with the goal of obtaining this information for all students seenat the health center. The health center should facilitate student enrollment in health insurance programssuch as Medi-Cal, Healthy Families or other local coverage options.Billing Capacity17. The health center shall bill CHDP, Medi-Cal, Healthy Families, health plans and/or other third partypayers as appropriate based on the lead agency, community and services provided.Access to Care18. Fees. The center serves all students in the school regardless of insurance status or ability to pay. Nostudent can be denied services because of inability to pay. The center may also serve siblings, parentsor other community members and may develop its own policies regarding fees and accessibility ofservices for these populations.19. Hours. The health center shall be open during hours accessible to its target population, and provisionsshould be in place for the same services to be delivered during times when the center is not open.These provisions shall be posted, given to and/or explained to clients including at a minimum ananswering service/machine message. The health center shall have a written plan for after-hours andweekend care, which shall be posted, given to, and/or explained to clients.20. Transportation. If the health center is not on school grounds, there is a mechanism to facilitatetransportation from the school to the health center, or to ensure a safe pedestrian corridor to/from thehealth center, if necessary. This mechanism will be publicized appropriately with clients and families.21. Non-discrimination. Students shall not be denied access to services based on race, color, nationalorigin, religion, immigration status, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, handicap or gender.22. Language. Reasonable accommodation shall be made to provide language/translation services to non-English speaking and deaf students.Quality Improvement23. Adherence to relevant standards of care adopted by national professional organizations – AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics, Society for Adolescent Medicine, American Dental Association, etc.24. Gathering of feedback from both clients and school stakeholders through annual needs/resourceassessments and age-appropriate client satisfaction surveys as well as satisfaction surveys withparents and school staff. Focus groups or a “comments box” can also be used for this AdvisoryCommittee26. School-based health centers should maintain a local advisory committee that meets at least two timesper year. The committee membership should include at least two representatives from the schoolstaff, parents, and students (if middle or high school). The committee should also include two healthcare providers outside the school-based health center (e.g., community-based primary care providers,hospitals, community clinics), public agencies (e.g., local health department, county office of education,probation, county mental health department), and local community-based organizations. The function ofthe committee is to:a. Provide input on school or community issues related to student health.b. Make recommendations for the type of services that the school-based health center should start,continue, expand or discontinue.c. Make recommendations for policies and procedures at the school-based health center.d. Develop an annual summary of school-based health center work and recommendations that will bemade public (e.g. to school board, school leadership team)* The advisory committee is not meant to usurp the authority of an existing FQHC advisory board and mayfunction as a subcommittee or workgroup of a larger advisory board.Data Collection27. Certain data variables shall be collected at each encounter or visit including:a. Unique patient identifier (not name)b. Date of birthc. Genderd. Ethnicity/Racee.Insurance statusf. Date of visitg. Location of visit (site identification)h. Provider typei. CPT visit code(s) (for MediCal providers only)j. Diagnostic code(s) (ICD-9 or 10)k. Selected risk factor statusl.

School-based health centers with a community health center or hospital serving as the medical servicesprovider must be licensed by the California Department of Public Health as an independent clinic,affiliate clinic, satellite clinic, or mobile van of the community health center or hospital. District-runschool-based health centers are waived from this licensing requirement by the state.41. School medical service provider agencies, whether a community health center, hospital, or schooldistrict, must be certified as CHDP and/or Medi-Cal providers.42.

Some licensed professional staff may work remotely via a telehealth system, so long as appropriatesupport staff is on-site to facilitate the telehealth assessment or treatment.Coordination with Primary Care Providers47. The school-based health center should develop procedures for communicating with the primary careproviders (PCPs) of the clients for whom the school-based health center is not serving as the PCP.These procedures are necessary to promote continuity of care, facilitate provider collaboration, assureappropriate utilization of health resources, and ensure appropriate protection of confidentiality.48. When a student’s PCP and/or health plan are identified, the PCP and/or health plan should be notifiedevery time the patient/member receives a prescription for a new medication or adjustment of existingmedication.49.

SBHC services are available to students and, in somecases, to members of the public. The services may include medical care, mental health / behavioral healthservices, and dental care. The most common types of organizations that operate SBHCs are:• Federally qualified health centers• School districts• County health departments• HospitalsDSA has jurisdiction over public school construction projects (kindergarten through 12th grade and communitycolleges), reviews and approves project plans for compliance with Title 24 building standards (California Codeof Regulations), and provides construction oversight. Most SBHC facilities projects are under the jurisdiction ofDSA because they are located on public school campuses. When a proposed SBHC facility is to be housed withina new building (to be built) or housed within an existing building (to be altered) on a public school campus, theschool district owner is responsible for obtaining DSA approval of the design and construction work, in accordancewith Section 3 of this Bulletin.In addition, many SBHC facilities projects may require review by the California Department of Public Health(CDPH) and compliance with Title 24 OSHPD-3 requirements, as outlined in Section 4 of this Bulletin.In all cases, the school district and the non-school district entities that are involved in the project should work inclose partnership with each other, with DSA and any relevant state and local government entities, to ensure thatthe facility meets all relevant requirements.DSA oversees construction projects on California public school campuses by providing plan review and approval,and construction oversight of projects, in response to applications from California school districts.DSA’s oversight for structural safety of school facilities is governed by the provisions of the Field Act containedin the California Education Code, Sections 17280, et. seq. In summary, the Field Act imposes the followingrequirements on California schools aimed at ensuring structural safety of school buildings:•Licensed design professionals must prepare drawings and specifications (construction documents) forproposed construction work.• Construction documents have to be verified by DSA for compliance with applicable building codes.• A project owner (school district) must hire a DSA-certified project inspector to oversee construction anda testing laboratory accepted by DSA to perform necessary tests and special inspections. The inspectormust be approved by the project design professional(s) and DSA.• Changes to approved construction documents for DSA-regulated portions of the project shall beapproved by DSA prior to commencement of work.• At the conclusion of construction, the design professionals, the inspector and the contractor shall fileverified reports with DSA indicating that the work has been performed in compliance with the DSA-approved construction documents.Typically, the following types of projects require DSA review and approval for compliance with Title 24 (CaliforniaBuilding Standards):• New construction of school buildings and structures.• Alterations to school buildings.•Installation of new and relocation of existing relocatable school buildings.• Rehabilitation, defined as retrofitting of an existing nonconforming building (or a school buildingconforming to earlier code requirements) to bring the building, or portion thereof, into conformance withcurrent safety standards.Any time the SBHC facilities are to be housed within an existing school building, or will be housed within a stand-alone building located on a school campus, DSA review and approval must be obtained, unless the project meetsthe provisions of DSA Interpretation of Regulations (IR), as described below.There are two types of exemptions that may be applicable to SBHC facilities:1. Alteration projects with estimated construction cost below a specified amount may be exempt from DSAreview when certain requirements are met. For detailed information regarding this type of exemption,refer to Section 1.1, IR A-10: Alteration and Reconstruction Projects – Exemption from DSA Approval.2.In the event that the SBHC facilities will be housed in a stand-alone relocatable building on an existingschool campus, and the district elects to utilize the provisions of Education Code section 17296, thebuilding construction may be exempted from being reviewed and approved by DSA (a relocatable buildinghas an integral floor structure which is capable of being readily moved; a relocatable typically consists oftwo or more factory-built modules). In this case, the governing board of the school district must make aresolution to utilize Education Code section 17296, and shall ensure that the construction of the SBHCfacility proceeds with all applicable approvals, including approvals by the building department of theappropriate local jurisdiction.Additionally, the provisions of Section 4-310, Part 1, California Administrative Code shall be met. SBHCbuildings not approved by DSA shall not be used by students and teachers for school purposes, includinghousing the school nurse and his/her office for treatment of students and teachers. The buildings shall befenced (without gates) from the school campus a minimum distance equal to the height of the structure.The school board shall pass a resolution stating the building will not be used for school purposes bystudents and teachers. The building shall be posted with a sign pursuant to Education Code section 17368.If and when the SBHC function of the facility is discontinued, the school board must remove therelocatable building from the campus or rehabilitate it for school use in accordance with Section 4-307,Part 1, California Administrative Code.Community clinics, which provide healthcare services at many SBHCs, are licensed by CDPH, and their facilitiesrequire an architect or local building department’s confirmation of compliance with the Title 24 (California BuildingCode) for OSHPD-3 facilities. OSHPD-3 requirements for clinics are applied to facilities that are licensed pursuantto Health and Safety Code section 1200 (which includes primary care clinics and specialty clinics) or Health andSafety Code section 1250 (which includes outpatient services of a hospital).Compliance with Title 24 standards for clinics is the responsibility of the SBHC operator and its designprofessional(s). DSA review does not include verification of compliance with Title 24 standards for clinics(OSHPD-3).For more information regarding SBHCs, visit the California School Health Centers Association atwww.schoolhealthcenters.org, or contact by phone at (510) 268-1260.For a detailed description of DSA review and approval process, visit the DSA website www.dgs.ca.gov/dsa. Forquestions related to the plan review and construction oversight, contact the DSA Regional Office with jurisdictionover the county in which the school district is located (see DSA Regions Map).If a licensed community health clinic will provide services at the SBHC, it should review the CDPH requirements,including OSHPD-3 compliance, which are in addition to DSA requirements.
